I would not by my will have troubled you;But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,I will no further chide you.I could not stay behind you: my desire,More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;And not all love to see you, though so muchAs might have drawn one to a longer voyage,But jealousy what might befall your travel,Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,Unguided and unfriended, often proveRough and unhospitable: my willing love,The rather by these arguments of fear,Set forth in your pursuit.My kind Antonio,I can no other answer make but thanks,And thanks; and ever [         ] oft good turnsAre shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,You should find better dealing. What's to do?Shall we go see the reliques of this town?To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:I pray you, let us satisfy our eyesWith the memorials and the things of fameThat do renown this city.Would you'ld pardon me;I do not without danger walk these streets:Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleysI did some service; of such note indeed,That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.Belike you slew great number of his people.The offence is not of such a bloody nature;Albeit the quality of the time and quarrelMight well have given us bloody argument.It might have since been answer'd in repayingWhat we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,Most of our city did: only myself stood out;For which, if I be lapsed in this place,I shall pay dear.Do not then walk too open.It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledgeWith viewing of the town: there shall you have me.Why I your purse?Haply your eye shall light upon some toyYou have desire to purchase; and your store,I think, is not for idle markets, sir.I'll be your purse-bearer and leave youFor an hour.To the Elephant.I do remember.
