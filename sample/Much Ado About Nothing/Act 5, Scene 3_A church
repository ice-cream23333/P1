Is this the monument of Leonato?It is, my lord.[Reading out of a scroll]Done to death by slanderous tonguesWas the Hero that here lies:Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,Gives her fame which never dies.So the life that died with shameLives in death with glorious fame.Hang thou there upon the tomb,Praising her when I am dumb.Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.SONG.Pardon, goddess of the night,Those that slew thy virgin knight;For the which, with songs of woe,Round about her tomb they go.Midnight, assist our moan;Help us to sigh and groan,Heavily, heavily:Graves, yawn and yield your dead,Till death be uttered,Heavily, heavily.Now, unto thy bones good night!Yearly will I do this rite.Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,Before the wheels of Phoebus, round aboutDapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.Good morrow, masters: each his several way.Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;And then to Leonato's we will go.And Hymen now with luckier issue speed'sThan this for whom we render'd up this woe.
