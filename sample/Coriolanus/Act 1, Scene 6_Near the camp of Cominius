Breathe you, my friends: well fought;we are come offLike Romans, neither foolish in our stands,Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,By interims and conveying gusts we have heardThe charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!Lead their successes as we wish our own,That both our powers, with smilingfronts encountering,May give you thankful sacrifice.Thy news?The citizens of Corioli have issued,And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:I saw our party to their trenches driven,And then I came away.Though thou speak'st truth,Methinks thou speak'st not well.How long is't since?Above an hour, my lord.'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,And bring thy news so late?Spies of the VolscesHeld me in chase, that I was forced to wheelThree or four miles about, else had I, sir,Half an hour since brought my report.Who's yonder,That does appear as he were flay'd? O godsHe has the stamp of Marcius; and I haveBefore-time seen him thus.[Within]                 Come I too late?The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabourMore than I know the sound of Marcius' tongueFrom every meaner man.Come I too late?Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,But mantled in your own.O, let me clip yeIn arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heartAs merry as when our nuptial day was done,And tapers burn'd to bedward!Flower of warriors,How is it with Titus Lartius?As with a man busied about decrees:Condemning some to death, and some to exile;Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,To let him slip at will.Where is that slaveWhich told me they had beat you to your trenches?Where is he? call him hither.Let him alone;He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budgeFrom rascals worse than they.But how prevail'd you?Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?If not, why cease you till you are so?Marcius,We have at disadvantage fought and didRetire to win our purpose.How lies their battle? know you on which sideThey have placed their men of trust?As I guess, Marcius,Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,Their very heart of hope.I do beseech you,By all the battles wherein we have fought,By the blood we have shed together, by the vowsWe have made to endure friends, that you directlySet me against Aufidius and his Antiates;And that you not delay the present, but,Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,We prove this very hour.Though I could wishYou were conducted to a gentle bathAnd balms applied to, you, yet dare I neverDeny your asking: take your choice of thoseThat best can aid your action.Those are theyThat most are willing. If any such be here--As it were sin to doubt--that love this paintingWherein you see me smear'd; if any fearLesser his person than an ill report;If any think brave death outweighs bad lifeAnd that his country's dearer than himself;Let him alone, or so many so minded,Wave thus, to express his disposition,And follow Marcius.O, me alone! make you a sword of me?If these shows be not outward, which of youBut is four Volsces? none of you but isAble to bear against the great AufidiusA shield as hard as his. A certain number,Though thanks to all, must I selectfrom all: the restShall bear the business in some other fight,As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;And four shall quickly draw out my command,Which men are best inclined.March on, my fellows:Make good this ostentation, and you shallDivide in all with us.
