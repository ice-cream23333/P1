He that had wit would think that I had none,To bury so much gold under a tree,And never after to inherit it.Let him that thinks of me so abjectlyKnow that this gold must coin a stratagem,Which, cunningly effected, will begetA very excellent piece of villany:And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrestThat have their alms out of the empress' chest.My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?The birds chant melody on every bush,The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,The green leaves quiver with the cooling windAnd make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,As if a double hunt were heard at once,Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;And, after conflict such as was supposedThe wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,When with a happy storm they were surprisedAnd curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birdsBe unto us as is a nurse's songOf lullaby to bring her babe asleep.Madam, though Venus govern your desires,Saturn is dominator over mine:What signifies my deadly-standing eye,My silence and my cloudy melancholy,My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurlsEven as an adder when she doth unrollTo do some fatal execution?No, madam, these are no venereal signs:Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,This is the day of doom for Bassianus:His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,Thy sons make pillage of her chastityAnd wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.Now question me no more; we are espied;Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sonsTo back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?Or is it Dian, habited like her,Who hath abandoned her holy grovesTo see the general hunting in this forest?Saucy controller of our private steps!Had I the power that some say Dian had,Thy temples should be planted presentlyWith horns, as was Actaeon's; and the houndsShould drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,Unmannerly intruder as thou art!Under your patience, gentle empress,'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;And to be doubted that your Moor and youAre singled forth to try experiments:Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.Believe me, queen, your swarth CimmerianDoth make your honour of his body's hue,Spotted, detested, and abominable.Why are you sequester'd from all your train,Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,If foul desire had not conducted you?And, being intercepted in your sport,Great reason that my noble lord be ratedFor sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;This valley fits the purpose passing well.The king my brother shall have note of this.Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:Good king, to be so mightily abused!Why have I patience to endure all this?How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:A barren detested vale, you see it is;The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,They told me, here, at dead time of the night,A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,Would make such fearful and confused criesAs any mortal body hearing itShould straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.No sooner had they told this hellish tale,But straight they told me they would bind me hereUnto the body of a dismal yew,And leave me to this miserable death:And then they call'd me foul adulteress,Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest termsThat ever ear did hear to such effect:And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,This vengeance on me had they executed.Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.This is a witness that I am thy son.And this for me, struck home to show my strength.Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,For no name fits thy nature but thy own!Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boysYour mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:This minion stood upon her chastity,Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:And shall she carry this unto her grave?An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.But when ye have the honey ye desire,Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.I warrant you, madam, we wil l make that sure.Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoyThat nice-preserved honesty of yours.O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--I will not hear her speak; away with her!Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.Listen, fair madam: let it be your gloryTo see her tears; but be your heart to themAs unrelenting flint to drops of rain.When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--The lion moved with pity did endureTo have his princely paws pared all away:Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!I know not what it means; away with her!O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,That gave thee life, when well he might haveslain thee,Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,Even for his sake am I pitiless.Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,To save your brother from the sacrifice;But fierce Andronicus would not relent;Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,The worse to her, the better loved of me.O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,And with thine own hands kill me in this place!For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go.'Tis present death I beg; and one thing moreThat womanhood denies my tongue to tell:O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,And tumble me into some loathsome pit,Where never man's eye may behold my body:Do this, and be a charitable murderer.So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!The blot and enemy to our general name!Confusion fall--Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure.Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,Till all the Andronici be made away.Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.Come on, my lords, the better foot before:Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pitWhere I espied the panther fast asleep.My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.And mine, I promise you; were't not for shame,Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed bloodAs fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?A very fatal place it seems to me.Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?O brother, with the dismall'st object hurtThat ever eye with sight made heart lament![Aside]  Now will I fetch the king to find them here,That he thereby may give a likely guessHow these were they that made away his brother.Why dost not comfort me, and help me outFrom this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?I am surprised with an uncouth fear;A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,Aaron and thou look down into this den,And see a fearful sight of blood and death.Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heartWill not permit mine eyes once to beholdThe thing whereat it trembles by surmise;O, tell me how it is; for ne'er till nowWas I a child to fear I know not what.Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?Upon his bloody finger he doth wearA precious ring, that lightens all the hole,Which, like a taper in some monument,Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:So pale did shine the moon on PyramusWhen he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.O brother, help me with thy fainting hand--If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath--Out of this fell devouring receptacle,As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,I may be pluck'd into the swallowing wombOf this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,Till thou art here aloft, or I below:Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,And what he is that now is leap'd into it.Say who art thou that lately didst descendInto this gaping hollow of the earth?The unhappy son of old Andronicus:Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,To find thy brother Bassianus dead.My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:He and his lady both are at the lodgeUpon the north side of this pleasant chase;'Tis not an hour since I left him there.We know not where you left him all alive;But, out, alas! here have we found him dead.Where is my lord the king?Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.Where is thy brother Bassianus?Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,The complot of this timeless tragedy;And wonder greatly that man's face can foldIn pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.[Reads]  'An if we miss to meet him handsomely--Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean--Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy rewardAmong the nettles at the elder-treeWhich overshades the mouth of that same pitWhere we decreed to bury Bassianus.Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'O Tamora! was ever heard the like?This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman outThat should have murdered Bassianus here.My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.[To TITUS]  Two of thy whelps, fell curs ofbloody kind,Have here bereft my brother of his life.Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:There let them bide until we have devisedSome never-heard-of torturing pain for them.What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!How easily murder is discovered!High emperor, upon my feeble kneeI beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,That this fell fault of my accursed sons,Accursed if the fault be proved in them,--If it be proved! you see it is apparent.Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?Andronicus himself did take it up.I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vowThey shall be ready at your highness' willTo answer their suspicion with their lives.Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers:Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,That end upon them should be executed.Andronicus, I will entreat the king;Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.
