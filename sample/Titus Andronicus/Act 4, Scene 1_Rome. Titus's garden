Help, grandsire, help! my aunt LaviniaFollows me every where, I know not why:Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:Somewhither would she have thee go with her.Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more careRead to her sons than she hath read to theeSweet poetry and Tully's Orator.Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,Extremity of griefs would make men mad;And I have read that Hecuba of TroyRan mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;Although, my lord, I know my noble auntLoves me as dear as e'er my mother did,And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:Which made me down to throw my books, and fly--Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,I will most willingly attend your ladyship.Lucius, I will.How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?Some book there is that she desires to see.Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.But thou art deeper read, and better skill'dCome, and take choice of all my library,And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavensReveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?I think she means that there was more than oneConfederate in the fact: ay, more there was;Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;My mother gave it me.For love of her that's gone,Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?This is the tragic tale of Philomel,And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--O, had we never, never hunted there!--Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,By nature made for murders and for rapes.O, why should nature build so foul a den,Unless the gods delight in tragedies?Give signs, sweet girl, for here are nonebut friends,What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,Inspire me, that I may this treason find!My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canstThis after me, when I have writ my nameWithout the help of any hand at all.Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!Write thou good niece; and here display, at last,What God will have discover'd for revenge;Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,That we may know the traitors and the truth!O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'What, what! the lustful sons of TamoraPerformers of this heinous, bloody deed?Magni Dominator poli,Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I knowThere is enough written upon this earthTo stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughtsAnd arm the minds of infants to exclaims.My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;And swear with me, as, with the woful fereAnd father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,That we will prosecute by good adviceMortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,And see their blood, or die with this reproach.'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,She's with the lion deeply still in league,And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,And when he sleeps will she do what she list.You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,And with a gad of steel will write these words,And lay it by: the angry northern windWill blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad,And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?I say, my lord, that if I were a man,Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safeFor these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oftFor his ungrateful country done the like.And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.Come, go with me into mine armoury;Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,Shalt carry from me to the empress' sonsPresents that I intend to send them both:Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,And not relent, or not compassion him?Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,That hath more scars of sorrow in his heartThan foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;But yet so just that he will not revenge.Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!
