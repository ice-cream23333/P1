The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:Uncouple here and let us make a bayAnd wake the emperor and his lovely brideAnd rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,That all the court may echo with the noise.Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,To attend the emperor's person carefully:I have been troubled in my sleep this night,But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.Many good morrows to your majesty;Madam, to you as many and as good:I promised your grace a hunter's peal.And you have rung it lustily, my lord;Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.Lavinia, how say you?I say, no;I have been broad awake two hours and more.Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have,And to our sport.Madam, now shall ye seeOur Roman hunting.I have dogs, my lord,Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,And climb the highest promontory top.And I have horse will follow where the gameMakes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.
