I see a man's life is a tedious one:I have tired myself, and for two nights togetherHave made the ground my bed. I should be sick,But that my resolution helps me. Milford,When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I thinkFoundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told meI could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tisA punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulnessIs sorer than to lie for need, and falsehoodIs worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,My hunger's gone; but even before, I wasAt point to sink for food. But what is this?Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:I were best not to call; I dare not call:yet famine,Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness everOf hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.Best draw my sword: and if mine enemyBut fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.Such a foe, good heavens!You, Polydote, have proved best woodman andAre master of the feast: Cadwal and IWill play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:The sweat of industry would dry and die,But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachsWill make what's homely savoury: wearinessCan snore upon the flint, when resty slothFinds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,Poor house, that keep'st thyself!I am thoroughly weary.I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.[Looking into the cave]Stay; come not in.But that it eats our victuals, I should thinkHere were a fairy.What's the matter, sir?By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,An earthly paragon! Behold divinenessNo elder than a boy!Good masters, harm me not:Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thoughtTo have begg'd or bought what I have took:good troth,I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had foundGold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:I would have left it on the board so soonAs I had made my meal, and partedWith prayers for the provider.Money, youth?All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of thoseWho worship dirty gods.I see you're angry:Know, if you kill me for my fault, I shouldHave died had I not made it.Whither bound?To Milford-Haven.What's your name?Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman whoIs bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,I am fall'n in this offence.Prithee, fair youth,Think us no churls, nor measure our good mindsBy this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheerEre you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.Boys, bid him welcome.Were you a woman, youth,I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,I bid for you as I'd buy.I'll make't my comfortHe is a man; I'll love him as my brother:And such a welcome as I'd give to himAfter long absence, such is yours: most welcome!Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.'Mongst friends,If brothers.Would it had been so, that theyHad been my father's sons! then had my prizeBeen less, and so more equal ballastingTo thee, Posthumus.He wrings at some distress.Would I could free't!Or I, whate'er it be,What pain it cost, what danger. God's!Hark, boys.Great men,That had a court no bigger than this cave,That did attend themselves and had the virtueWhich their own conscience seal'd them--laying byThat nothing-gift of differing multitudes--Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!I'd change my sex to be companion with them,Since Leonatus's false.It shall be so.Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,So far as thou wilt speak it.Pray, draw near.The night to the owl and morn to the larkless welcome.Thanks, sir.I pray, draw near.
