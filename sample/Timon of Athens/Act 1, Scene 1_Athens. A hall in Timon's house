Good day, sir.I am glad you're well.I have not seen you long: how goes the world?It wears, sir, as it grows.Ay, that's well known:But what particular rarity? what strange,Which manifold record not matches? See,Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy powerHath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.O, 'tis a worthy lord.Nay, that's most fix'd.A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,To an untirable and continuate goodness:He passes.Jeweller:	I have a jewel here--O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?Jeweller:	If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--[Reciting to himself]  'When we for recompense havepraised the vile,It stains the glory in that happy verseWhich aptly sings the good.''Tis a good form.And rich: here is a water, look ye.You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedicationTo the great lord.A thing slipp'd idly from me.Our poesy is as a gum, which oozesFrom whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flintShows not till it be struck; our gentle flameProvokes itself and like the current fliesEach bound it chafes. What have you there?A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.Let's see your piece.'Tis a good piece.So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.Indifferent.Admirable: how this graceSpeaks his own standing! what a mental powerThis eye shoots forth! how big imaginationMoves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gestureOne might interpret.It is a pretty mocking of the life.Here is a touch; is't good?I will say of it,It tutors nature: artificial strifeLives in these touches, livelier than life.How this lord is follow'd!The senators of Athens: happy man!Look, more!You see this confluence, this great floodof visitors.I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hugWith amplest entertainment: my free driftHalts not particularly, but moves itselfIn a wide sea of wax: no levell'd maliceInfects one comma in the course I hold;But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,Leaving no tract behind.How shall I understand you?I will unbolt to you.You see how all conditions, how all minds,As well of glib and slippery creatures asOf grave and austere quality, tender downTheir services to Lord Timon: his large fortuneUpon his good and gracious nature hangingSubdues and properties to his love and tendanceAll sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flattererTo Apemantus, that few things loves betterThan to abhor himself: even he drops downThe knee before him, and returns in peaceMost rich in Timon's nod.I saw them speak together.Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hillFeign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mountIs rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,That labour on the bosom of this sphereTo propagate their states: amongst them all,Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;Whose present grace to present slaves and servantsTranslates his rivals.'Tis conceived to scope.This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,With one man beckon'd from the rest below,Bowing his head against the sleepy mountTo climb his happiness, would be well express'dIn our condition.Nay, sir, but hear me on.All those which were his fellows but of late,Some better than his value, on the momentFollow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,Make sacred even his stirrup, and through himDrink the free air.Ay, marry, what of these?When Fortune in her shift and change of moodSpurns down her late beloved, all his dependantsWhich labour'd after him to the mountain's topEven on their knees and hands, let him slip down,Not one accompanying his declining foot.'Tis common:A thousand moral paintings I can showThat shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune'sMore pregnantly than words. Yet you do wellTo show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seenThe foot above the head.Imprison'd is he, say you?Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,His means most short, his creditors most strait:Your honourable letter he desiresTo those have shut him up; which failing,Periods his comfort.Noble Ventidius! Well;I am not of that feather to shake offMy friend when he must need me. I do know himA gentleman that well deserves a help:Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,and free him.Your lordship ever binds him.Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,But to support him after. Fare you well.All happiness to your honour!Lord Timon, hear me speak.Freely, good father.Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.I have so: what of him?Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!Here, at your lordship's service.This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,By night frequents my house. I am a manThat from my first have been inclined to thrift;And my estate deserves an heir more raisedThan one which holds a trencher.Well; what further?One only daughter have I, no kin else,On whom I may confer what I have got:The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,And I have bred her at my dearest costIn qualities of the best. This man of thineAttempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,Join with me to forbid him her resort;Myself have spoke in vain.The man is honest.Therefore he will be, Timon:His honesty rewards him in itself;It must not bear my daughter.Does she love him?She is young and apt:Our own precedent passions do instruct usWhat levity's in youth.[To LUCILIUS]           Love you the maid?Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.If in her marriage my consent be missing,I call the gods to witness, I will chooseMine heir from forth the beggars of the world,And dispossess her all.How shall she be endow'd,if she be mated with an equal husband?Three talents on the present; in future, all.This gentleman of mine hath served me long:To build his fortune I will strain a little,For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,And make him weigh with her.Most noble lord,Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.Humbly I thank your lordship: never mayThe state or fortune fall into my keeping,Which is not owed to you!Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:Go not away. What have you there, my friend?A piece of painting, which I do beseechYour lordship to accept.Painting is welcome.The painting is almost the natural man;or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,He is but outside: these pencill'd figures areEven such as they give out. I like your work;And you shall find I like it: wait attendanceTill you hear further from me.The gods preserve ye!Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewelHath suffer'd under praise.What, my lord! dispraise?A more satiety of commendations.If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,It would unclew me quite.My lord, 'tis ratedAs those which sell would give: but you well know,Things of like value differing in the ownersAre prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,You mend the jewel by the wearing it.Well mock'd.No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,Which all men speak with him.Look, who comes here: will you be chid?Jeweller: We'll bear, with your lordship.He'll spare none.Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.Are they not Athenians?Yes.Then I repent not.Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus?Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.Thou art proud, Apemantus.Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.Whither art going?To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.That's a deed thou'lt die for.Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?The best, for the innocence.Wrought he not well that painted it?He wrought better that made the painter; and yethe's but a filthy piece of work.You're a dog.Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?No; I eat not lords.An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.That's a lascivious apprehension.So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost aman a doit.What dost thou think 'tis worth?Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!How now, philosopher!Thou liest.Art not one?Yes.Then I lie not.Art not a poet?Yes.Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thouhast feigned him a worthy fellow.That's not feigned; he is so.Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thylabour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!What wouldst do then, Apemantus?E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.What, thyself?Ay.Wherefore?That I had no angry wit to be a lord.Art not thou a merchant?Ay, Apemantus.Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!If traffic do it, the gods do it.Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!What trumpet's that?'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,All of companionship.Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.You must needs dine with me: go not you henceTill I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.Most welcome, sir!So, so, there!Aches contract and starve your supple joints!That there should be small love 'mongst thesesweet knaves,And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred outInto baboon and monkey.Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feedMost hungerly on your sight.Right welcome, sir!Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous timeIn different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.What time o' day is't, Apemantus?Time to be honest.That time serves still.The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.Fare thee well, fare thee well.Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.Why, Apemantus?Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean togive thee none.Hang thyself!No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thyrequests to thy friend.Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoesThe very heart of kindness.He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,Is but his steward: no meed, but he repaysSevenfold above itself; no gift to him,But breeds the giver a return exceedingAll use of quittance.The noblest mind he carriesThat ever govern'd man.Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?I'll keep you company.
