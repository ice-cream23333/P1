Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his filesAs full as thy report?have spoke the least:Besides, his expedition promisesPresent approach.We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;Whom, though in general part we were opposed,Yet our old love made a particular force,And made us speak like friends: this man was ridingFrom Alcibiades to Timon's cave,With letters of entreaty, which importedHis fellowship i' the cause against your city,In part for his sake moved.Here come our brothers.No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouringDoth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.
