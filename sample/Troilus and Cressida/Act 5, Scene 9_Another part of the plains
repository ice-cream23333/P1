Hark! hark! what shout is that?Peace, drums!Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles.The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.If it be so, yet bragless let it be;Great Hector was a man as good as he.March patiently along: let one be sentTo pray Achilles see us at our tent.If in his death the gods have us befriended,Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.
