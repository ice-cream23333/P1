Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;He shall unbolt the gates.Trouble him not;To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,And give as soft attachment to thy sensesAs infants' empty of all thought!Good morrow, then.I prithee now, to bed.Are you a-weary of me?O Cressida! but that the busy day,Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,I would not from thee.Night hath been too brief.Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she staysAs tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of loveWith wings more momentary-swift than thought.You will catch cold, and curse me.Prithee, tarry:You men will never tarry.O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,And then you would have tarried. Hark!there's one up.[Within]  What, 's all the doors open here?It is your uncle.A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:I shall have such a life!How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, youmaid! where's my cousin Cressid?Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.To do what? to do what? let her saywhat: what have I brought you to do?Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,Nor suffer others.Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughtyman, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.My lord, come you again into my chamber:You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.Ha, ha!Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:I would not for half Troy have you seen here.Who's there? what's the matter? will you beatdown the door? How now! what's the matter?Good morrow, lord, good morrow.Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,I knew you not: what news with you so early?Is not Prince Troilus here?Here! what should he do here?Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:It doth import him much to speak with me.Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'llbe sworn: for my own part, I came in late. Whatshould he do here?Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrongere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to befalse to him: do not you know of him, but yet gofetch him hither; go.How now! what's the matter?My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,My matter is so rash: there is at handParis your brother, and Deiphobus,The Grecian Diomed, and our AntenorDeliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,We must give up to Diomedes' handThe Lady Cressida.Is it so concluded?By Priam and the general state of Troy:They are at hand and ready to effect it.How my achievements mock me!I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,We met by chance; you did not find me here.Good, good, my lord; the secrets of natureHave not more gift in taciturnity.Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The deviltake Antenor! the young prince will go mad: aplague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!How now! what's the matter? who was here?Ah, ah!Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!O the gods! what's the matter?Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er beenborn! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poorgentleman! A plague upon Antenor!Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,what's the matter?Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thouart changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.O you immortal gods! I will not go.Thou must.I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;I know no touch of consanguinity;No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near meAs the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,Do to this body what extremes you can;But the strong base and building of my loveIs as the very centre of the earth,Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--Do, do.Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heartWith sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.
