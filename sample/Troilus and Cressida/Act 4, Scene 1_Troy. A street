See, ho! who is that there?It is the Lord AEneas.Is the prince there in person?Had I so good occasion to lie longAs you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly businessShould rob my bed-mate of my company.That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--Witness the process of your speech, whereinYou told how Diomed, a whole week by days,Did haunt you in the field.Health to you, valiant sir,During all question of the gentle truce;But when I meet you arm'd, as black defianceAs heart can think or courage execute.The one and other Diomed embraces.Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!But when contention and occasion meet,By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy lifeWith all my force, pursuit and policy.And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will flyWith his face backward. In humane gentleness,Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,No man alive can love in such a sortThe thing he means to kill more excellently.We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,If to my sword his fate be not the glory,A thousand complete courses of the sun!But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!We know each other well.We do; and long to know each other worse.This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.What business, lord, so early?I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this GreekTo Calchas' house, and there to render him,For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:Let's have your company, or, if you please,Haste there before us: I constantly do think--Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:Rouse him and give him note of our approach.With the whole quality wherefore: I fearWe shall be much unwelcome.That I assure you:Troilus had rather Troy were borne to GreeceThan Cressid borne from Troy.There is no help;The bitter disposition of the timeWill have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.Good morrow, all.And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,Myself or Menelaus?Both alike:He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,Not making any scruple of her soilure,With such a hell of pain and world of charge,And you as well to keep her, that defend her,Not palating the taste of her dishonour,With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:He, like a puling cuckold, would drink upThe lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;You, like a lecher, out of whorish loinsAre pleased to breed out your inheritors:Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;But he as he, the heavier for a whore.You are too bitter to your countrywoman.She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:For every false drop in her bawdy veinsA Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scrupleOf her contaminated carrion weight,A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,She hath not given so many good words breathAs for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:But we in silence hold this virtue well,We'll but commend what we intend to sell.Here lies our way.
