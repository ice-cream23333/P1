Come here about me, you my Myrmidons;Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:And when I have the bloody Hector found,Empale him with your weapons round about;In fellest manner execute your aims.Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye:It is decreed Hector the great must die.The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now,bull! now, dog! 'Loo, Paris, 'loo! now my double-henned sparrow! 'loo, Paris, 'loo! The bull has thegame: ware horns, ho!Turn, slave, and fight.What art thou?A bastard son of Priam's.I am a bastard too; I love bastards: I am a bastardbegot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastardin valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear willnot bite another, and wherefore should one bastard?Take heed, the quarrel's most ominous to us: if theson of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment:farewell, bastard.The devil take thee, coward!
