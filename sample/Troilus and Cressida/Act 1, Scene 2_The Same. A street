Who were those went by?Queen Hecuba and Helen.And whither go they?Up to the eastern tower,Whose height commands as subject all the vale,To see the battle. Hector, whose patienceIs, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,And, like as there were husbandry in war,Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,And to the field goes he; where every flowerDid, as a prophet, weep what it foresawIn Hector's wrath.What was his cause of anger?The noise goes, this: there is among the GreeksA lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;They call him Ajax.Good; and what of him?They say he is a very man per se,And stands alone.So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of theirparticular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a maninto whom nature hath so crowded humours that hisvalour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced withdiscretion: there is no man hath a virtue that hehath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but hecarries some stain of it: he is melancholy withoutcause, and merry against the hair: he hath thejoints of every thing, but everything so out of jointthat he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.But how should this man, that makesme smile, make Hector angry?They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle andstruck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hathever since kept Hector fasting and waking.Who comes here?Madam, your uncle Pandarus.Hector's a gallant man.As may be in the world, lady.What's that? what's that?Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? Whenwere you at Ilium?This morning, uncle.What were you talking of when I came? Was Hectorarmed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was notup, was she?Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.Even so: Hector was stirring early.That were we talking of, and of his anger.Was he angry?So he says here.True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll layabout him to-day, I can tell them that: and there'sTroilus will not come far behind him: let them takeheed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.What, is he angry too?Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.O Jupiter! there's no comparison.What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know aman if you see him?Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.So he is.Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.He is not Hector.Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' werehimself! Well, the gods are above; time must friendor end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart werein her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.Excuse me.He is elder.Pardon me, pardon me.Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me anothertale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall nothave his wit this year.He shall not need it, if he have his own.Nor his qualities.No matter.Nor his beauty.'Twould not become him; his own's better.You have no judgment, niece: Helenherself swore th' other day, that Troilus, fora brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--not brown neither,--No, but brown.'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.To say the truth, true and not true.She praised his complexion above Paris.Why, Paris hath colour enough.So he has.Then Troilus should have too much: if she praisedhim above, his complexion is higher than his; hehaving colour enough, and the other higher, is tooflaming a praise for a good complexion. I had aslief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus fora copper nose.I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.Then she's a merry Greek indeed.Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' otherday into the compassed window,--and, you know, hehas not past three or four hairs on his chin,--Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring hisparticulars therein to a total.Why, he is very young: and yet will he, withinthree pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she cameand puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smilingbecomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.O, he smiles valiantly.Does he not?O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helenloves Troilus,--Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'llprove it so.Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteeman addle egg.If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idlehead, you would eat chickens i' the shell.I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickledhis chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, Imust needs confess,--Without the rack.And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughedthat her eyes ran o'er.With mill-stones.And Cassandra laughed.But there was more temperate fire under the pot ofher eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?And Hector laughed.At what was all this laughing?Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.An't had been a green hair, I should have laughedtoo.They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.What was his answer?Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on yourchin, and one of them is white.This is her question.That's true; make no question of that. 'Two andfifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that whitehair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.''Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck'tout, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all therest so laughed, that it passed.So let it now; for it has been while going by.Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.So I do.I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twerea man born in April.And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettleagainst May.Hark! they are coming from the field: shall westand up here, and see them as they pass towardIlium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.At your pleasure.Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we maysee most bravely: I'll tell you them all by theirnames as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.Speak not so loud.That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one ofthe flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but markTroilus; you shall see anon.Who's that?That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundestjudgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: ifhe see me, you shall see him nod at me.Will he give you the nod?You shall see.If he do, the rich shall have more.That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's afellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there'sa countenance! is't not a brave man?O, a brave man!Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look youwhat hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, doyou see? look you there: there's no jesting;there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:there be hacks!Be those with swords?Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil cometo him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one'sheart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he camehurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will doHelen's heart good now, ha! Would I could seeTroilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.Who's that?That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That'sHelenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.Can Helenus fight, uncle?Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. Imarvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear thepeople cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.What sneaking fellow comes yonder?Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! theprince of chivalry!Peace, for shame, peace!Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well uponhim, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, andhis helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er sawthree and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, tochange, would give an eye to boot.Here come more.Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!porridge after meat! I could live and die i' theeyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eaglesare gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I hadrather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon andall Greece.There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.Well, well.'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? haveyou any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is notbirth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no datein the pie, for then the man's date's out.You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward youlie.Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, todefend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend minehonesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, todefend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at athousand watches.Say one of your watches.Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of thechiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I wouldnot have hit, I can watch you for telling how I tookthe blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it'spast watching.You are such another!Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.Where?At your own house; there he unarms him.Good boy, tell him I come.I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.Adieu, uncle.I'll be with you, niece, by and by.To bring, uncle?Ay, a token from Troilus.By the same token, you are a bawd.Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,He offers in another's enterprise;But more in Troilus thousand fold I seeThan in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:That she was never yet that ever knewLove got so sweet as when desire did sue.Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
