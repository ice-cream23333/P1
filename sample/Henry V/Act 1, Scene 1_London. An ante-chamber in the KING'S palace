My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reignWas like, and had indeed against us pass'd,But that the scambling and unquiet timeDid push it out of farther question.But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?It must be thought on. If it pass against us,We lose the better half of our possession:For all the temporal lands which men devoutBy testament have given to the churchWould they strip from us; being valued thus:As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;And, to relief of lazars and weak age,Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.A hundred almshouses right well supplied;And to the coffers of the king beside,A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.This would drink deep.'Twould drink the cup and all.But what prevention?The king is full of grace and fair regard.And a true lover of the holy church.The courses of his youth promised it not.The breath no sooner left his father's body,But that his wildness, mortified in him,Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very momentConsideration, like an angel, cameAnd whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,Leaving his body as a paradise,To envelop and contain celestial spirits.Never was such a sudden scholar made;Never came reformation in a flood,With such a heady currance, scouring faultsNor never Hydra-headed wilfulnessSo soon did lose his seat and all at onceAs in this king.We are blessed in the change.Hear him but reason in divinity,And all-admiring with an inward wishYou would desire the king were made a prelate:Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,You would say it hath been all in all his study:List his discourse of war, and you shall hearA fearful battle render'd you in music:Turn him to any cause of policy,The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;So that the art and practic part of lifeMust be the mistress to this theoric:Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,Since his addiction was to courses vain,His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,And never noted in him any study,Any retirement, any sequestrationFrom open haunts and popularity.The strawberry grows underneath the nettleAnd wholesome berries thrive and ripen bestNeighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:And so the prince obscured his contemplationUnder the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.It must be so; for miracles are ceased;And therefore we must needs admit the meansHow things are perfected.But, my good lord,How now for mitigation of this billUrged by the commons? Doth his majestyIncline to it, or no?He seems indifferent,Or rather swaying more upon our partThan cherishing the exhibiters against us;For I have made an offer to his majesty,Upon our spiritual convocationAnd in regard of causes now in hand,Which I have open'd to his grace at large,As touching France, to give a greater sumThan ever at one time the clergy yetDid to his predecessors part withal.How did this offer seem received, my lord?With good acceptance of his majesty;Save that there was not time enough to hear,As I perceived his grace would fain have done,The severals and unhidden passagesOf his true titles to some certain dukedomsAnd generally to the crown and seat of FranceDerived from Edward, his great-grandfather.What was the impediment that broke this off?The French ambassador upon that instantCraved audience; and the hour, I think, is comeTo give him hearing: is it four o'clock?It is.Then go we in, to know his embassy;Which I could with a ready guess declare,Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.
