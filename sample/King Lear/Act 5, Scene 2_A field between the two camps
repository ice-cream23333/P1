Here, father, take the shadow of this treeFor your good host; pray that the right may thrive:If ever I return to you again,I'll bring you comfort.Grace go with you, sir!Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:Give me thy hand; come on.No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endureTheir going hence, even as their coming hither;Ripeness is all: come on.And that's true too.
