Save thee, Curan.And you, sir. I have been with your father, andgiven him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Reganhis duchess will be here with him this night.How comes that?Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet butear-kissing arguments?Not I	pray you, what are they?Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt theDukes of Cornwall and Albany?Not a word.You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.The duke be here to-night? The better! best!This weaves itself perforce into my business.My father hath set guard to take my brother;And I have one thing, of a queasy question,Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!My father watches: O sir, fly this place;Intelligence is given where you are hid;You have now the good advantage of the night:Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,And Regan with him: have you nothing saidUpon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?Advise yourself.I am sure on't, not a word.I hear my father coming: pardon me:In cunning I must draw my sword upon youDraw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkardsDo more than this in sport. Father, father!Stop, stop! No help?Now, Edmund, where's the villain?Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moonTo stand auspicious mistress,--But where is he?Look, sir, I bleed.Where is the villain, Edmund?Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--Pursue him, ho! Go after.By no means what?Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;But that I told him, the revenging gods'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bondThe child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,Seeing how loathly opposite I stoodTo his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,With his prepared sword, he charges homeMy unprovided body, lanced mine arm:But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,Or whether gasted by the noise I made,Full suddenly he fled.Let him fly far:Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:By his authority I will proclaim it,That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;He that conceals him, death.When I dissuaded him from his intent,And found him pight to do it, with curst speechI threaten'd to discover him: he replied,'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,If I would stand against thee, would the reposalOf any trust, virtue, or worth in theeMake thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--As this I would: ay, though thou didst produceMy very character,--I'ld turn it allTo thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:And thou must make a dullard of the world,If they not thought the profits of my deathWere very pregnant and potential spursTo make thee seek it.'Strong and fasten'd villainWould he deny his letter? I never got him.Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;The duke must grant me that: besides, his pictureI will send far and near, that all the kingdomMay have the due note of him; and of my land,Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the meansTo make thee capable.How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.If it be true, all vengeance comes too shortWhich can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!What, did my father's godson seek your life?He whom my father named? your Edgar?O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!Was he not companion with the riotous knightsThat tend upon my father?I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.Yes, madam, he was of that consort.No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,To have the expense and waste of his revenues.I have this present evening from my sisterBeen well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,That if they come to sojourn at my house,I'll not be there.Nor I, assure thee, Regan.Edmund, I hear that you have shown your fatherA child-like office.'Twas my duty, sir.He did bewray his practise; and receivedThis hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.Is he pursued?Ay, my good lord.If he be taken, he shall never moreBe fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,Whose virtue and obedience doth this instantSo much commend itself, you shall be ours:Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;You we first seize on.I shall serve you, sir,Truly, however else.For him I thank your grace.You know not why we came to visit you,--Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,Wherein we must have use of your advice:Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,Of differences, which I least thought it fitTo answer from our home; the several messengersFrom hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestowYour needful counsel to our business,Which craves the instant use.I serve you, madam:Your graces are right welcome.
