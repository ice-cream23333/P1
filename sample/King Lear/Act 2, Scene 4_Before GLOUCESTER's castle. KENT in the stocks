'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,And not send back my messenger.As I learn'd,The night before there was no purpose in themOf this remove.Hail to thee, noble master!Ha!Makest thou this shame thy pastime?No, my lord.Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tiedby the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys bythe loins, and men by the legs: when a man'sover-lusty at legs, then he wears woodennether-stocks.What's he that hath so much thy place mistookTo set thee here?It is both he and she;Your son and daughter.No.Yes.No, I say.I say, yea.No, no, they would not.Yes, they have.By Jupiter, I swear, no.By Juno, I swear, ay.They durst not do 't;They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,To do upon respect such violent outrage:Resolve me, with all modest haste, which wayThou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,Coming from us.My lord, when at their homeI did commend your highness' letters to them,Ere I was risen from the place that show'dMy duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forthFrom Goneril his mistress salutations;Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,Which presently they read: on whose contents,They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;Commanded me to follow, and attendThe leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:And meeting here the other messenger,Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--Being the very fellow that of lateDisplay'd so saucily against your highness,--Having more man than wit about me, drew:He raised the house with loud and coward cries.Your son and daughter found this trespass worthThe shame which here it suffers.Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.Fathers that wear ragsDo make their children blind;But fathers that bear bagsShall see their children kind.Fortune, that arrant whore,Ne'er turns the key to the poor.But, for all this, thou shalt have as many doloursfor thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?With the earl, sir, here within.Follow me not;Stay here.Made you no more offence but what you speak of?None.How chance the king comes with so small a train?And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for thatquestion, thou hadst well deserved it.Why, fool?We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach theethere's no labouring i' the winter. All that followtheir noses are led by their eyes but blind men; andthere's not a nose among twenty but can smell himthat's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheelruns down a hill, lest it break thy neck withfollowing it: but the great one that goes up thehill, let him draw thee after. When a wise mangives thee better counsel, give me mine again: Iwould have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.That sir which serves and seeks for gain,And follows but for form,Will pack when it begins to rain,And leave thee in the storm,But I will tarry; the fool will stay,And let the wise man fly:The knave turns fool that runs away;The fool no knave, perdy.Where learned you this, fool?Not i' the stocks, fool.Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;The images of revolt and flying off.Fetch me a better answer.My dear lord,You know the fiery quality of the duke;How unremoveable and fix'd he isIn his own course.Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?Ay, my good lord.The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear fatherWould with his daughter speak, commands her service:Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--No, but not yet: may be he is not well:Infirmity doth still neglect all officeWhereto our health is bound; we are not ourselvesWhen nature, being oppress'd, commands the mindTo suffer with the body: I'll forbear;And am fall'n out with my more headier will,To take the indisposed and sickly fitFor the sound man. Death on my state! whereforeShould he sit here? This act persuades meThat this remotion of the duke and herIs practise only. Give me my servant forth.Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drumTill it cry sleep to death.I would have all well betwixt you.O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eelswhen she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'emo' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in purekindness to his horse, buttered his hay.Good morrow to you both.Hail to your grace!I am glad to see your highness.Regan, I think you are; I know what reasonI have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,Sepulchring an adultress.O, are you free?Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tiedSharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believeWith how depraved a quality--O Regan!I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.You less know how to value her desertThan she to scant her duty.Say, how is that?I cannot think my sister in the leastWould fail her obligation: if, sir, perchanceShe have restrain'd the riots of your followers,'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,As clears her from all blame.My curses on her!O, sir, you are old.Nature in you stands on the very vergeOf her confine: you should be ruled and ledBy some discretion, that discerns your stateBetter than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,That to our sister you do make return;Say you have wrong'd her, sir.Ask her forgiveness?Do you but mark how this becomes the house:'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;Age is unnecessary: on my knees I begThat you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:Return you to my sister.[Rising]  Never, Regan:She hath abated me of half my train;Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:All the stored vengeances of heaven fallOn her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,You taking airs, with lameness!Fie, sir, fie!You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flamesInto her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,To fall and blast her pride!O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,When the rash mood is on.No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:Thy tender-hefted nature shall not giveThee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thineDo comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in theeTo grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,And in conclusion to oppose the boltAgainst my coming in: thou better know'stThe offices of nature, bond of childhood,Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,Wherein I thee endow'd.Good sir, to the purpose.Who put my man i' the stocks?What trumpet's that?I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,That she would soon be here.Is your lady come?This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd prideDwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.Out, varlet, from my sight!What means your grace?Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hopeThou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,If you do love old men, if your sweet swayAllow obedience, if yourselves are old,Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?All's not offence that indiscretion findsAnd dotage terms so.O sides, you are too tough;Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?I set him there, sir: but his own disordersDeserved much less advancement.You! did you?I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.If, till the expiration of your month,You will return and sojourn with my sister,Dismissing half your train, come then to me:I am now from home, and out of that provisionWhich shall be needful for your entertainment.Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?No, rather I abjure all roofs, and chooseTo wage against the enmity o' the air;To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless tookOur youngest born, I could as well be broughtTo knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension begTo keep base life afoot. Return with her?Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpterTo this detested groom.At your choice, sir.I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:We'll no more meet, no more see one another:But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,I and my hundred knights.Not altogether so:I look'd not for you yet, nor am providedFor your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;For those that mingle reason with your passionMust be content to think you old, and so--But she knows what she does.Is this well spoken?I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?Is it not well? What should you need of more?Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and dangerSpeak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,Should many people, under two commands,Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.Why might not you, my lord, receive attendanceFrom those that she calls servants or from mine?Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,We could control them. If you will come to me,--For now I spy a danger,--I entreat youTo bring but five and twenty: to no moreWill I give place or notice.I gave you all--And in good time you gave it.Made you my guardians, my depositaries;But kept a reservation to be follow'dWith such a number. What, must I come to youWith five and twenty, Regan? said you so?And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,When others are more wicked: not being the worstStands in some rank of praise.I'll go with thee:Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,And thou art twice her love.Hear me, my lord;What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,To follow in a house where twice so manyHave a command to tend you?What need one?O, reason not the need: our basest beggarsAre in the poorest thing superfluous:Allow not nature more than nature needs,Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;If only to go warm were gorgeous,Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,As full of grief as age; wretched in both!If it be you that stir these daughters' heartsAgainst their father, fool me not so muchTo bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,And let not women's weapons, water-drops,Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,I will have such revenges on you both,That all the world shall--I will do such things,--What they are, yet I know not: but they shall beThe terrors of the earth. You think I'll weepNo, I'll not weep:I have full cause of weeping; but this heartShall break into a hundred thousand flaws,Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.This house is little: the old man and his peopleCannot be well bestow'd.'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,And must needs taste his folly.For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,But not one follower.So am I purposed.Where is my lord of Gloucester?Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.The king is in high rage.Whither is he going?He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak windsDo sorely ruffle; for many miles a boutThere's scarce a bush.O, sir, to wilful men,The injuries that they themselves procureMust be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:He is attended with a desperate train;And what they may incense him to, being aptTo have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.
