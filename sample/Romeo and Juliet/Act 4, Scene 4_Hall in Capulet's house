Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:Spare not for the cost.Go, you cot-quean, go,Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrowFor this night's watching.No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere nowAll night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;But I will watch you from such watching now.A jealous hood, a jealous hood!Now, fellow,What's there?Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.Make haste, make haste.Sirrah, fetch drier logs:Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,And never trouble Peter for the matter.Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:The county will be here with music straight,For so he said he would: I hear him near.Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:Make haste, I say.
