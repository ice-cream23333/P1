Can I go forward when my heart is here?Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.Romeo! my cousin Romeo!He is wise;And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:Call, good Mercutio.Nay, I'll conjure too.Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thighAnd the demesnes that there adjacent lie,That in thy likeness thou appear to us!And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.This cannot anger him: 'twould anger himTo raise a spirit in his mistress' circleOf some strange nature, letting it there standTill she had laid it and conjured it down;That were some spite: my invocationIs fair and honest, and in his mistres s' nameI conjure only but to raise up him.Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,To be consorted with the humorous night:Blind is his love and best befits the dark.If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.Now will he sit under a medlar tree,And wish his mistress were that kind of fruitAs maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.Romeo, that she were, O, that she wereAn open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:Come, shall we go?Go, then; for 'tis in vainTo seek him here that means not to be found.
