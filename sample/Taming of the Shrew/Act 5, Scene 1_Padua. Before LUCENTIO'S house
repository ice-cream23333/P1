Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need theeat home; therefore leave us.Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; andthen come back to my master's as soon as I can.I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:My father's bears more toward the market-place;Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.You shall not choose but drink before you go:I think I shall command your welcome here,And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.They're busy within; you were best knock louder.What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, tomake merry withal?Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shallneed none, so long as I live.Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father iscome from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and herelooking out at the window.Art thou his father?Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.[To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman! why, thisis flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name.Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means tocozen somebody in this city under my countenance.I have seen them in the church together: God send'em good shipping! But who is here? mine oldmaster Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.[Seeing BIONDELLO]Come hither, crack-hemp.Hope I may choose, sir.Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for Inever saw you before in all my life.What, you notorious villain, didst thou never seethy master's father, Vincentio?What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:see where he looks out of the window.Is't so, indeed.Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end ofthis controversy.Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortalgods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvethose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, Iam undone! I am undone! while I play the goodhusband at home, my son and my servant spend all atthe university.How now! what's the matter?What, is the man lunatic?Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by yourhabit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? Ithank my good father, I am able to maintain it.Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what doyou think is his name?His name! as if I knew not his name: I have broughthim up ever since he was three years old, and hisname is Tranio.Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he ismine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay holdon him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, myson, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?Call forth an officer.Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,I charge you see that he be forthcoming.Carry me to the gaol!Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you becony-catched in this business: I dare swear thisis the right Vincentio.Swear, if thou darest.Nay, I dare not swear it.Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: Omonstrous villain!O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,forswear him, or else we are all undone.[Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.Lives my sweet son?Pardon, dear father.How hast thou offended?Where is Lucentio?Here's Lucentio,Right son to the right Vincentio;That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!Where is that damned villain Tranio,That faced and braved me in this matter so?Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?Cambio is changed into Lucentio.Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's loveMade me exchange my state with Tranio,While he did bear my countenance in the town;And happily I have arrived at the lastUnto the wished haven of my bliss.What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sentme to the gaol.But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughterwithout asking my good will?Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: butI will in, to be revenged for this villany.And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.First kiss me, Kate, and we will.What, in the midst of the street?What, art thou ashamed of me?No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:Better once than never, for never too late.
