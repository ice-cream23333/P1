Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,And says that once more I shall interchangeMy waned state for Henry's regal crown.Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seasAnd brought desired help from Burgundy:What then remains, we being thus arrivedFrom Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,But that we enter, as into our dukedom?The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;For many men that stumble at the thresholdAre well foretold that danger lurks within.Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:By fair or foul means we must enter in,For hither will our friends repair to us.My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.True, my good lord; I know you for no less.Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,As being well content with that alone.[Aside]  But when the fox hath once got in his nose,He'll soon find means to make the body follow.Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!The good old man would fain that all were well,So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuadeBoth him and all his brothers unto reason.So, master mayor: these gates must not be shutBut in the night or in the time of war.What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;For Edward will defend the town and thee,And all those friends that deign to follow me.Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?To help King Edward in his time of storm,As every loyal subject ought to do.Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forgetOur title to the crown and only claimOur dukedom till God please to send the rest.Then fare you well, for I will hence again:I came to serve a king and not a duke.Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.Nay, stay, Sir John, awhi le, and we'll debateBy what safe means the crown may be recover'd.What talk you of debating? in few words,If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,I'll leave you to your fortune and be goneTo keep them back that come to succor you:Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,And Henry but usurps the diadem.Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;And now will I be Edward's champion.Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king ofEngland and France, and lord of Ireland,  & c.And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,By this I challenge him to single fight.Long live Edward the Fourth!Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;And when the morning sun shall raise his carAbove the border of this horizon,We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems theeTo flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.
