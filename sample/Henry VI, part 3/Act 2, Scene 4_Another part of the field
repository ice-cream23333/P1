Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;And here's the heart that triumphs in their deathAnd cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brotherTo execute the like upon thyself;And so, have at thee!Nay Warwick, single out some other chase;For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.
