Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,Sit down with us: it ill befits thy stateAnd birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.No, mighty King of France: now MargaretMust strike her sail and learn awhile to serveWhere kings command. I was, I must confess,Great Albion's queen in former golden days:But now mischance hath trod my title down,And with dishonour laid me on the ground;Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,And to my humble seat conform myself.Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tearsAnd stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,And sit thee by our side:Yield not thy neckTo fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mindStill ride in triumph over all mischance.Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughtsAnd give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,That Henry, sole possessor of my love,Is of a king become a banish'd man,And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;While proud ambitious Edward Duke of YorkUsurps the regal title and the seatOf England's true-anointed lawful king.This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;Our people and our peers are both misled,Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,While we bethink a means to break it off.The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;For this is he that moves both wind and tide.From worthy Edward, King of Albion,My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,First, to do greetings to thy royal person;And then to crave a league of amity;And lastly, to confirm that amityWith a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grantThat virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,To England's king in lawful marriage.[Aside]  If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.[To BONA]  And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,I am commanded, with your leave and favour,Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongueTo tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,Before you answer Warwick. His demandSprings not from Edward's well-meant honest love,But from deceit bred by necessity;For how can tyrants safely govern home,Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriageThou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.Injurious Margaret!And why not queen?Because thy father Henry did usurp;And thou no more are prince than she is queen.Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,Who by his prowess conquered all France:From these our Henry lineally descends.Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lostAll that which Henry Fifth had gotten?Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.But for the rest, you tell a pedigreeOf threescore and two years; a silly timeTo make prescription for a kingdom's worth.Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,And not bewray thy treason with a blush?Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.Call him my king by whose injurious doomMy elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,Was done to death? and more than so, my father,Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,When nature brought him to the door of death?No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.And I the house of York.Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,While I use further conference with Warwick.Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,Is Edward your true king? for I were loathTo link with him that were not lawful chosen.Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.But is he gracious in the people's eye?The more that Henry was unfortunate.Then further, all dissembling set aside,Tell me for truth the measure of his loveUnto our sister Bona.Such it seemsAs may beseem a monarch like himself.Myself have often heard him say and swearThat this his love was an eternal plant,Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:Yet I confess that often ere this day,When I have heard your king's desert recounted,Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;And now forthwith shall articles be drawnTouching the jointure that your king must make,Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witnessThat Bona shall be wife to the English king.To Edward, but not to the English king.Deceitful Warwick! it was thy deviceBy this alliance to make void my suit:Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.And still is friend to him and Margaret:But if your title to the crown be weak,As may appear by Edward's good success,Then 'tis but reason that I be releasedFrom giving aid which late I promised.Yet shall you have all kindness at my handThat your estate requires and mine can yield.Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,You have a father able to maintain you;And better 'twere you troubled him than France.Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,Proud setter up and puller down of kings!I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,Both full of truth, I make King Lewis beholdThy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.[To WARWICK]  My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:These from our king unto your majesty:And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.I like it well that our fair queen and mistressSmiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:I hope all's for the best.Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.What! has your king married the Lady Grey!And now, to soothe your forgery and his,Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?I told your majesty as much before:This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,No more my king, for he dishonours me,But most himself, if he could see his shame.Did I forget that by the house of YorkMy father came untimely to his death?Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?Did I impale him with the regal crown?Did I put Henry from his native right?And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:And to repair my honour lost for him,I here renounce him and return to Henry.My noble queen, let former grudges pass,And henceforth I am thy true servitor:I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,And replant Henry in his former state.Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;And I forgive and quite forget old faults,And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish usWith some few bands of chosen soldiers,I'll undertake to land them on our coastAnd force the tyrant from his seat by war.'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,He's very likely now to fall from him,For matching more for wanton lust than honour,Or than for strength and safety of our country.Dear brother, how shall Bona be revengedBut by thy help to this distressed queen?Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?My quarrel and this English queen's are one.And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.Therefore at last I firmly am resolvedYou shall have aid.Let me give humble thanks for all at once.Then, England's messenger, return in post,And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,That Lewis of France is sending over masquersTo revel it with him and his new bride:Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,And I am ready to put armour on.Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.There's thy reward: be gone.But, Warwick,Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;And, as occasion serves, this noble queenAnd prince shall follow with a fresh supply.Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?This shall assure my constant loyalty,That if our queen and this young prince agree,I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joyTo him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,For mocking marriage with a dame of France.I came from Edward as ambassador,But I return his sworn and mortal foe:Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,But dreadful war shall answer his demand.Had he none else to make a stale but me?Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.I was the chief that raised him to the crown,And I'll be chief to bring him down again:Not that I pity Henry's misery,But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
