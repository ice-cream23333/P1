Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and weShall take upon 's what else remains to do,According to our order.Fare you well.Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
