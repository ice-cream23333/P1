Come, my masters; the duchess, I tell you, expectsperformance of your promises.Master Hume, we are therefore provided: will herladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?Ay, what else? fear you not her courage.I have heard her reported to be a woman of aninvincible spirit: but it shall be convenient,Master Hume, that you be by her aloft, while we bebusy below; and so, I pray you, go, in God's name,and leave us.Mother Jourdain, be youprostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwell,read you; and let us to our work.Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To thisgear the sooner the better.Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,The time of night when Troy was set on fire;The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves,That time best fits the work we have in hand.Madam, sit you and fear not: whom we raise,We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.Adsum.Asmath,By the eternal God, whose name and powerThou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;For, till thou speak, thou shalt not pass from hence.Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!'First of the king: what shall of him become?'The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;But him outlive, and die a violent death.'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'By water shall he die, and take his end.'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'Let him shun castles;Safer shall he be upon the sandy plainsThan where castles mounted stand.Have done, for more I hardly can endure.Descend to darkness and the burning lake!False fiend, avoid!Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch.What, madam, are you there? the king and commonwealAre deeply indebted for this piece of pains:My lord protector will, I doubt it not,See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.Not half so bad as thine to England's king,Injurious duke, that threatest where's no cause.True, madam, none at all: what call you this?Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close.And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.Stafford, take her to thee.We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.All, away!Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well:A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.What have we here?'The duke yet lives, that Henry shall depose;But him outlive, and die a violent death.'Why, this is just'Aio te, AEacida, Romanos vincere posse.'Well, to the rest:'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?By water shall he die, and take his end.What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?Let him shun castles;Safer shall he be upon the sandy plainsThan where castles mounted stand.'Come, come, my lords;These oracles are hardly attain'd,And hardly understood.The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's,With him the husband of this lovely lady:Thither go these news, as fast as horse cancarry them:A sorry breakfast for my lord protector.Your grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,To be the post, in hope of his reward.At your pleasure, my good lord. Who's withinthere, ho!Invite my Lords of Salisbury and WarwickTo sup with me to-morrow night. Away!
