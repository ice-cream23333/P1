Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath;they have been up these two days.They have the more need to sleep now, then.I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dressthe commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say itwas never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;which is as much to say as, let the magistrates belabouring men; and therefore should we bemagistrates.Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of abrave mind than a hard hand.I see them! I see them! there's Best's son, thetanner of Wingham,--He shall have the skin of our enemies, to makedog's-leather of.And Dick the Butcher,--Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity'sthroat cut like a calf.And Smith the weaver,--Argo, their thread of life is spun.Come, come, let's fall in with them.We John Cade, so termed of our supposed father,--[Aside]  Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired withthe spirit of putting down kings and princes,--Command silence.Silence!My father was a Mortimer,--[Aside]  He was an honest man, and a goodbricklayer.My mother a Plantagenet,--[Aside]  I knew her well; she was a midwife.My wife descended of the Lacies,--[Aside]  She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, andsold many laces.[Aside]  But now of late, notable to travel with herfurred pack, she washes bucks here at home.Therefore am I of an honourable house.[Aside]  Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable;and there was he borne, under a hedge, for hisfather had never a house but the cage.Valiant I am.[Aside]  A' must needs; for beggary is valiant.I am able to endure much.[Aside]  No question of that; for I have seen himwhipped three market-days together.I fear neither sword nor fire.[Aside]  He need not fear the sword; for his coat is of proof.[Aside]  But methinks he should stand in fear offire, being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep.Be brave, then; for your captain is brave, and vowsreformation. There shall be in England sevenhalfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hoopedpot; shall have ten hoops and I will make it felonyto drink small beer: all the realm shall be incommon; and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go tograss: and when I am king, as king I will be,--God save your majesty!I thank you, good people: there shall be no money;all shall eat and drink on my score; and I willapparel them all in one livery, that they may agreelike brothers and worship me their lord.The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentablething, that of the skin of an innocent lamb shouldbe made parchment? that parchment, being scribbledo'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:but I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but sealonce to a thing, and I was never mine own mansince. How now! who's there?The clerk of Chatham: he can write and read andcast accompt.O monstrous!We took him setting of boys' copies.Here's a villain!Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.Nay, then, he is a conjurer.Nay, he can make obligations, and write court-hand.I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man, of minehonour; unless I find him guilty, he shall not die.Come hither, sirrah, I must examine thee: what is thy name?Emmanuel.They use to write it on the top of letters: 'twillgo hard with you.Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name? orhast thou a mark to thyself, like an honestplain-dealing man?Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought upthat I can write my name.He hath confessed: away with him! he's a villainand a traitor.Away with him, I say! hang him with his pen andink-horn about his neck.Where's our general?Here I am, thou particular fellow.Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and hisbrother are hard by, with the king's forces.Stand, villain, stand, or I'll fell thee down. Heshall be encountered with a man as good as himself:he is but a knight, is a'?No.To equal him, I will make myself a knight presently.Rise up Sir John Mortimer.Now have at him!Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,Mark'd for the gallows, lay your weapons down;Home to your cottages, forsake this groom:The king is merciful, if you revolt.But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,If you go forward; therefore yield, or die.As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not:It is to you, good people, that I speak,Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign;For I am rightful heir unto the crown.Villain, thy father was a plasterer;And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?And Adam was a gardener.And what of that?Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not?Ay, sir.By her he had two children at one birth.That's false.Ay, there's the question; but I say, 'tis true:The elder of them, being put to nurse,Was by a beggar-woman stolen away;And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,Became a bricklayer when he came to age:His son am I; deny it, if you can.Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, andthe bricks are alive at this day to testify it;therefore deny it not.And will you credit this base drudge's words,That speaks he knows not what?Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.[Aside]  He lies, for I invented it myself.Go to, sirrah, tell the king from me, that, for hisfather's sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boyswent to span-counter for French crowns, I am contenthe shall reign; but I'll be protector over him.And furthermore, well have the Lord Say's head forselling the dukedom of Maine.And good reason; for thereby is England mained, andfain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holdsit up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Sayhath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch:and more than that, he can speak French; andtherefore he is a traitor.O gross and miserable ignorance!Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are ourenemies; go to, then, I ask but this: can he thatspeaks with the tongue of an enemy be a goodcounsellor, or no?No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,Assail them with the army of the king.Herald, away; and throughout every townProclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;That those which fly before the battle endsMay, even in their wives' and children's sight,Be hang'd up for example at their doors:And you that be the king's friends, follow me.And you that love the commons, follow me.Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.We will not leave one lord, one gentleman:Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;For they are thrifty honest men, and suchAs would, but that they dare not, take our parts.They are all in order and march toward us.But then are we in order when we are mostout of order. Come, march forward.
