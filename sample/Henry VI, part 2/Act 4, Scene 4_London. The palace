Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,And makes it fearful and degenerate;Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.But who can cease to weep and look on this?Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast:But where's the body that I should embrace?What answer makes your grace to the rebels'supplication?I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;For God forbid so many simple soulsShould perish by the sword! And I myself,Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,Will parley with Jack Cade their general:But stay, I'll read it over once again.Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely faceRuled, like a wandering planet, over me,And could it not enforce them to relent,That were unworthy to behold the same?Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.How now, madam!Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.How now! what news? why comest thou in such haste?The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,And calls your grace usurper openlyAnd vows to crown himself in Westminster.His army is a ragged multitudeOf hinds and peasants, rude and merciless:Sir Humphrey Stafford and h is brother's deathHath given them heart and courage to proceed:All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,They call false caterpillars, and intend their death.O graceless men! they know not what they do.My gracious lord, return to Killingworth,Until a power be raised to put them down.Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!Lord Say, the traitors hate thee;Therefore away with us to Killingworth.So might your grace's person be in danger.The sight of me is odious in their eyes;And therefore in this city will I stayAnd live alone as secret as I may.Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge:The citizens fly and forsake their houses:The rascal people, thirsting after prey,Join with the traitor, and they jointly swearTo spoil the city and your royal court.Then linger not, my lord, away, take horse.Come, Margaret; God, our hope, will succor us.My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.Farewell, my lord: trust not the Kentish rebels.Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd.The trust I have is in mine innocence,And therefore am I bold and resolute.
