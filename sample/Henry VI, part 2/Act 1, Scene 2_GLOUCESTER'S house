Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,As frowning at the favours of the world?Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,Enchased with all the honours of the world?If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,Until thy head be circled with the same.Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:And, having both together heaved it up,We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,And never more abase our sight so lowAs to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.And may that thought, when I imagine illAgainst my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,Be my last breathing in this mortal world!My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite itWith sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;And on the pieces of the broken wandWere placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk.This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.Tut, this was nothing but an argumentThat he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's groveShall lose his head for his presumption.But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:Methought I sat in seat of majestyIn the cathedral church of Westminster,And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to meAnd on my head did set the diadem.Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,Art thou not second woman in the realm,And the protector's wife, beloved of him?Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,Above the reach or compass of thy thought?And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,To tumble down thy husband and thyselfFrom top of honour to disgrace's feet?Away from me, and let me hear no more!What, what, my lord! are you so cholericWith Eleanor, for telling but her dream?Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,And not be cheque'd.Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.My lord protector, 'tis his highness' pleasureYou do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's,Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.Follow I must; I cannot go before,While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocksAnd smooth my way upon their headless necks;And, being a woman, I will not be slackTo play my part in Fortune's pageant.Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,We are alone; here's none but thee and I.Jesus preserve your royal majesty!What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,Your grace's title shall be multiplied.What say'st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'dWith Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?And will they undertake to do me good?This they have promised, to show your highnessA spirit raised from depth of under-ground,That shall make answer to such questionsAs by your grace shall be propounded him.It is enough; I'll think upon the questions:When from St. Alban's we do make return,We'll see these things effected to the full.Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man,With thy confederates in this weighty cause.Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:The business asketh silent secrecy.Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.Yet have I gold flies from another coast;I dare not say, from the rich cardinalAnd from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,Yet I do find it so; for to be plain,They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,Have hired me to undermine the duchessAnd buz these conjurations in her brain.They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go nearTo call them both a pair of crafty knaves.Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at lastHume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall:Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.
