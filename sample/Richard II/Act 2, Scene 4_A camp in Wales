My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,And hardly kept our countrymen together,And yet we hear no tidings from the king;Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.The bay-trees in our country are all wither'dAnd meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earthAnd lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,The other to enjoy by rage and war:These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,As well assured Richard their king is dead.Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mindI see thy glory like a shooting starFall to the base earth from the firmament.Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.
