This way the king will come; this is the wayTo Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,To whose flint bosom my condemned lordIs doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:Here let us rest, if this rebellious earthHave any resting for her true king's queen.But soft, but see, or rather do not see,My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,That you in pity may dissolve to dew,And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,When triumph is become an alehouse guest?Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,To think our former state a happy dream;From which awaked, the truth of what we areShows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,To grim Necessity, and he and IWill keep a league till death. Hie thee to FranceAnd cloister thee in some religious house:Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,Which our profane hours here have stricken down.What, is my Richard both in shape and mindTransform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposedThine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rageTo be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,And fawn on rage with base humility,Which art a lion and a king of beasts?A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,I had been still a happy king of men.Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.In winter's tedious nights sit by the fireWith good old folks and let them tell thee talesOf woeful ages long ago betid;And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,Tell thou the lamentable tale of meAnd send the hearers weeping to their beds:For why, the senseless brands will sympathizeThe heavy accent of thy moving tongueAnd in compassion weep the fire out;And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,For the deposing of a rightful king.My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;With all swift speed you must away to France.Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithalThe mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,The time shall not be many hours of ageMore than it is ere foul sin gathering headShalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,Though he divide the realm and give thee half,It is too little, helping him to all;And he shall think that thou, which know'st the wayTo plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,Being ne'er so little urged, another wayTo pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.The love of wicked men converts to fear;That fear to hate, and hate turns one or bothTo worthy danger and deserved death.My guilt be on my head, and there an end.Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violateA twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,And then betwixt me and my married wife.Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,She came adorned hither like sweet May,Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.And must we be divided? must we part?Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.Banish us both and send the king with me.That were some love but little policy.Then whither he goes, thither let me go.So two, together weeping, make one woe.Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.So longest way shall have the longest moans.Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,And piece the way out with a heavy heart.Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.Give me mine own again; 'twere no good partTo take on me to keep and kill thy heart.So, now I have mine own again, be gone,That I might strive to kill it with a groan.We make woe wanton with this fond delay:Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.
