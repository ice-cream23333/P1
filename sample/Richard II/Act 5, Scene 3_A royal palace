Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?'Tis full three months since I did see him last;If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.I would to God, my lords, he might be found:Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,With unrestrained loose companions,Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,Takes on the point of honour to supportSo dissolute a crew.My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.And what said the gallant?His answer was, he would unto the stews,And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,And wear it as a favour; and with thatHe would unhorse the lustiest challenger.As dissolute as desperate; yet through bothI see some sparks of better hope, which elder yearsMay happily bring forth. But who comes here?Where is the king?What means our cousin, that he stares and looksSo wildly?God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,To have some conference with your grace alone.Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.What is the matter with our cousin now?For ever may my knees grow to the earth,My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouthUnless a pardon ere I rise or speak.Intended or committed was this fault?If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,To win thy after-love I pardon thee.Then give me leave that I may turn the key,That no man enter till my tale be done.Have thy desire.[Within]  My liege, beware; look to thyself;Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.Villain, I'll make thee safe.Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.[Within]  Open the door, secure, foolhardy king:Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?Open the door, or I will break it open.What is the matter, uncle? speak;Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,That we may arm us to encounter it.Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt knowThe treason that my haste forbids me show.Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:I do repent me; read not my name thereMy heart is not confederate with my hand.It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:Forget to pity him, lest thy pity proveA serpent that will sting thee to the heart.O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!O loyal father of a treacherous son!Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,From when this stream through muddy passagesHath held his current and defiled himself!Thy overflow of good converts to bad,And thy abundant goodness shall excuseThis deadly blot in thy digressing son.So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.[Within]  What ho, my liege! for God's sake,let me in.What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.Speak with me, pity me, open the door.A beggar begs that never begg'd before.Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;This let alone will all the rest confound.O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!Love loving not itself none other can.Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.Rise up, good aunt.Not yet, I thee beseech:For ever will I walk upon my knees,And never see day that the happy sees,Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.Against them both my true joints bended be.Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:He prays but faintly and would be denied;We pray with heart and soul and all beside:His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them haveThat mercy which true prayer ought to have.Good aunt, stand up.Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.I never long'd to hear a word till now;Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:The word is short, but not so short as sweet;No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,That set'st the word itself against the word!Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;The chopping French we do not understand.Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.Good aunt, stand up.I do not sue to stand;Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,But makes one pardon strong.With all my heartI pardon him.A god on earth thou art.But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,With all the rest of that consorted crew,Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.Good uncle, help to order several powersTo Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:They shall not live within this world, I swear,But I will have them, if I once know where.Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.
