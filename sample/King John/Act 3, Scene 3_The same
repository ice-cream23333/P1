[To QUEEN ELINOR]  So shall it be; your grace shallstay behindSo strongly guarded.Cousin, look not sad:Thy grandam loves thee; and thy uncle willAs dear be to thee as thy father was.O, this will make my mother die with grief![To the BASTARD]  Cousin, away for England!haste before:And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bagsOf hoarding abbots; imprisoned angelsSet at liberty: the fat ribs of peaceMust by the hungry now be fed upon:Use our commission in his utmost force.Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,When gold and silver becks me to come on.I leave your highness. Grandam, I will pray,If ever I remember to be holy,For your fair safety; so, I kiss your hand.Farewell, gentle cousin.Coz, farewell.Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,We owe thee much! within this wall of fleshThere is a soul counts thee her creditorAnd with advantage means to pay thy love:And my good friend, thy voluntary oathLives in this bosom, dearly cherished.Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,But I will fit it with some better time.By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamedTo say what good respect I have of thee.I am much bounden to your majesty.Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,Yet it shall come from me to do thee good.I had a thing to say, but let it go:The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,Attended with the pleasures of the world,Is all too wanton and too full of gawdsTo give me audience: if the midnight bellDid, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,Sound on into the drowsy race of night;If this same were a churchyard where we stand,And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyesAnd strain their cheeks to idle merriment,A passion hateful to my purposes,Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,Hear me without thine ears, and make replyWithout a tongue, using conceit alone,Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.So well, that what you bid me undertake,Though that my death were adjunct to my act,By heaven, I would do it.Do not I know thou wouldst?Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eyeOn yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,He is a very serpent in my way;And whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread,He lies before me: dost thou understand me?Thou art his keeper.And I'll keep him so,That he shall not offend your majesty.Death.My lord?A grave.He shall not live.Enough.I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee;Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee:Remember. Madam, fare you well:I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty.My blessing go with thee!For England, cousin, go:Hubert shall be your man, attend on youWith all true duty. On toward Calais, ho!
