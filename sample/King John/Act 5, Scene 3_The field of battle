How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?This fever, that hath troubled me so long,Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,Desires your majesty to leave the fieldAnd send him word by me which way you go.Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.Be of good comfort; for the great supplyThat was expected by the Dauphin here,Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.This news was brought to Richard but even now:The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,And will not let me welcome this good news.Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.
