The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,When English measure backward their own groundIn faint retire. O, bravely came we off,When with a volley of our needless shot,After such bloody toil, we bid good night;And wound our tattering colours clearly up,Last in the field, and almost lords of it!Where is my prince, the Dauphin?Here: what news?The Count Melun is slain; the English lordsBy his persuasion are again fall'n off,And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!I did not think to be so sad to-nightAs this hath made me. Who was he that saidKing John did fly an hour or two beforeThe stumbling night did part our weary powers?Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:The day shall not be up so soon as I,To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.
