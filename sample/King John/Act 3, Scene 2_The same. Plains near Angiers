Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;Some airy devil hovers in the skyAnd pours down mischief. Austria's head lie there,While Philip breathes.Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up:My mother is assailed in our tent,And ta'en, I fear.My lord, I rescued her;Her highness is in safety, fear you not:But on, my liege; for very little painsWill bring this labour to an happy end.
