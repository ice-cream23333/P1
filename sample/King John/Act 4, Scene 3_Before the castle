The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!There's few or none do know me: if they did,This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.If I get down, and do not break my limbs,I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:As good to die and go, as die and stay.O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:It is our safety, and we must embraceThis gentle offer of the perilous time.Who brought that letter from the cardinal?The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,Whose private with me of the Dauphin's loveIs much more general than these lines import.To-morrow morning let us meet him then.Or rather then set forward; for 'twill beTwo long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!The king by me requests your presence straight.The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:We will not line his thin bestained cloakWith our pure honours, nor attend the footThat leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.Return and tell him so: we know the worst.Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.But there is little reason in your grief;Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.This is the prison. What is he lies here?O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.Murder, as hating what himself hath done,Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,Found it too precious-princely for a grave.Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,Or have you read or heard? or could you think?Or do you almost think, although you see,That you do see? could thought, without this object,Form such another? This is the very top,The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring ragePresented to the tears of soft remorse.All murders past do stand excused in this:And this, so sole and so unmatchable,Shall give a holiness, a purity,To the yet unbegotten sin of times;And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,Exampled by this heinous spectacle.It is a damned and a bloody work;The graceless action of a heavy hand,If that it be the work of any hand.If that it be the work of any hand!We had a kind of light what would ensue:It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;The practise and the purpose of the king:From whose obedience I forbid my soul,Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,And breathing to his breathless excellenceThe incense of a vow, a holy vow,Never to taste the pleasures of the world,Never to be infected with delight,Nor conversant with ease and idleness,Till I have set a glory to this hand,By giving it the worship of revenge.Our souls religiously confirm thy words.Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.O, he is old and blushes not at death.Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!I am no villain.Must I rob the law?Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;Lest I, by marking of your rage, forgetYour worth, your greatness and nobility.Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?Not for my life: but yet I dare defendMy innocent life against an emperor.Thou art a murderer.Do not prove me so;Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.Cut him to pieces.Keep the peace, I say.Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,That you shall think the devil is come from hell.What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?Second a villain and a murderer?Lord Bigot, I am none.Who kill'd this prince?'Tis not an hour since I left him well:I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weepMy date of life out for his sweet life's loss.Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,For villany is not without such rheum;And he, long traded in it, makes it seemLike rivers of remorse and innocency.Away with me, all you whose souls abhorThe uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;For I am stifled with this smell of sin.Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!There tell the king he may inquire us out.Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?Beyond the infinite and boundless reachOf mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,Art thou damn'd, Hubert.Do but hear me, sir.Ha! I'll tell thee what;Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hellAs thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.Upon my soul--If thou didst but consentTo this most cruel act, do but despair;And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest threadThat ever spider twisted from her wombWill serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beamTo hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,Put but a little water in a spoon,And it shall be as all the ocean,Enough to stifle such a villain up.I do suspect thee very grievously.If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breathWhich was embounded in this beauteous clay,Let hell want pains enough to torture me.I left him well.Go, bear him in thine arms.I am amazed, methinks, and lose my wayAmong the thorns and dangers of this world.How easy dost thou take all England up!From forth this morsel of dead royalty,The life, the right and truth of all this realmIs fled to heaven; and England now is leftTo tug and scamble and to part by the teethThe unowed interest of proud-swelling state.Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majestyDoth dogged war bristle his angry crestAnd snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:Now powers from home and discontents at homeMeet in one line; and vast confusion waits,As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,The imminent decay of wrested pomp.Now happy he whose cloak and cincture canHold out this tempest. Bear away that childAnd follow me with speed: I'll to the king:A thousand businesses are brief in hand,And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.
