Have patience, gentle Julia.I must, where is no remedy.When possibly I can, I will return.If you turn not, you will return the sooner.Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.Here is my hand for my true constancy;And when that hour o'erslips me in the dayWherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,The next ensuing hour some foul mischanceTorment me for my love's forgetfulness!My father stays my coming; answer not;The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;That tide will stay me longer than I should.Julia, farewell!What, gone without a word?Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.Go; I come, I come.Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
