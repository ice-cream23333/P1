Come, come,Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.A thousand more mischances than this oneHave learn'd me how to brook this patiently.Come, bring her away.Where is the gentleman that was with her?Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,But Moyses and Valerius follow him.Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,And will not use a woman lawlessly.O Valentine, this I endure for thee!
