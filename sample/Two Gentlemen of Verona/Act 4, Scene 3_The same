This is the hour that Madam SilviaEntreated me to call and know her mind:There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.Madam, madam!Who calls?Your servant and your friend;One that attends your ladyship's command.Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.As many, worthy lady, to yourself:According to your ladyship's impose,I am thus early come to know what serviceIt is your pleasure to command me in.O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:Thou art not ignorant what dear good willI bear unto the banish'd Valentine,Nor how my father would enforce me marryVain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee sayNo grief did ever come so near thy heartAs when thy lady and thy true love died,Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,I do desire thy worthy company,Upon whose faith and honour I repose.Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,And on the justice of my flying hence,To keep me from a most unholy match,Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.I do desire thee, even from a heartAs full of sorrows as the sea of sands,To bear me company and go with me:If not, to hide what I have said to thee,That I may venture to depart alone.Madam, I pity much your grievances;Which since I know they virtuously are placed,I give consent to go along with you,Recking as little what betideth meAs much I wish all good befortune you.When will you go?This evening coming.Where shall I meet you?At Friar Patrick's cell,Where I intend holy confession.I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.
