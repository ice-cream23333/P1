So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;You do remember all the circumstance?Remember it, my lord?Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,That would not let me sleep: methought I layWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,And praised be rashness for it, let us know,Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach usThere's a divinity that shapes our ends,Rough-hew them how we will,--That is most certain.Up from my cabin,My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the darkGroped I to find out them; had my desire.Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrewTo mine own room again; making so bold,My fears forgetting manners, to unsealTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--O royal knavery!--an exact command,Larded with many several sorts of reasonsImporting Denmark's health and England's too,With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,My head should be struck off.Is't possible?Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?I beseech you.Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,They had begun the play--I sat me down,Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:I once did hold it, as our statists do,A baseness to write fair and labour'd muchHow to forget that learning, but, sir, nowIt did me yeoman's service: wilt thou knowThe effect of what I wrote?Ay, good my lord.An earnest conjuration from the king,As England was his faithful tributary,As love between them like the palm might flourish,As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wearAnd stand a comma 'tween their amities,And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,That, on the view and knowing of these contents,Without debatement further, more or less,He should the bearers put to sudden death,Not shriving-time allow'd.How was this seal'd?Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.I had my father's signet in my purse,Which was the model of that Danish seal;Folded the writ up in form of the other,Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,The changeling never known. Now, the next dayWas our sea-fight; and what to this was sequentThou know'st already.So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.Why, man, they did make love to this employment;They are not near my conscience; their defeatDoes by their own insinuation grow:'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comesBetween the pass and fell incensed pointsOf mighty opposites.Why, what a king is this!Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,Thrown out his angle for my proper life,And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,To let this canker of our nature comeIn further evil?It must be shortly known to him from EnglandWhat is the issue of the business there.It will be short: the interim is mine;And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'But I am very sorry, good Horatio,That to Laertes I forgot myself;For, by the image of my cause, I seeThe portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put meInto a towering passion.Peace! who comes here?Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?No, my good lord.Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice toknow him. He hath much land, and fertile: let abeast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand atthe king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,spacious in the possession of dirt.Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, Ishould impart a thing to you from his majesty.I will receive it, sir, with all diligence ofspirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.I thank your lordship, it is very hot.No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind isnortherly.It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for mycomplexion.Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, hismajesty bade me signify to you that he has laid agreat wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--I beseech you, remember--Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believeme, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellentdifferences, of very soft society and great showing:indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card orcalendar of gentry, for you shall find in him thecontinent of what part a gentleman would see.Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;though, I know, to divide him inventorially woulddizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yawneither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in theverity of extolment, I take him to be a soul ofgreat article; and his infusion of such dearth andrareness, as, to make true diction of him, hissemblable is his mirror; and who else would tracehim, his umbrage, nothing more.Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentlemanin our more rawer breath?Sir?Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?You will do't, sir, really.What imports the nomination of this gentleman?Of Laertes?His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.Of him, sir.I know you are not ignorant--I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,it would not much approve me. Well, sir?You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--I dare not confess that, lest I should compare withhim in excellence; but, to know a man well, were toknow himself.I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputationlaid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.What's his weapon?Rapier and dagger.That's two of his weapons: but, well.The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbaryhorses: against the which he has imponed, as I takeit, six French rapiers and poniards, with theirassigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of thecarriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, veryresponsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,and of very liberal conceit.What call you the carriages?I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.The carriages, sir, are the hangers.The phrase would be more german to the matter, if wecould carry cannon by our sides: I would it mightbe hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horsesagainst six French swords, their assigns, and threeliberal-conceited carriages; that's the French betagainst the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passesbetween yourself and him, he shall not exceed youthree hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and itwould come to immediate trial, if your lordshipwould vouchsafe the answer.How if I answer 'no'?I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please hismajesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; letthe foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and theking hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.I commend my duty to your lordship.Yours, yours.He does well to commend it himself; there are notongues else for's turn.This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that Iknow the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune ofthe time and outward habit of encounter; a kind ofyesty collection, which carries them through andthrough the most fond and winnowed opinions; and dobut blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.My lord, his majesty commended him to you by youngOsric, who brings back to him that you attend him inthe hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold toplay with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king'spleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; nowor whensoever, provided I be so able as now.The king and queen and all are coming down.In happy time.The queen desires you to use some gentleentertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.She well instructs me.You will lose this wager, my lord.I do not think so: since he went into France, Ihave been in continual practise: I shall win at theodds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's hereabout my heart: but it is no matter.Nay, good my lord,--It is but foolery; but it is such a kind ofgain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I willforestall their repair hither, and say you are notfit.Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a specialprovidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will benow; if it be not now, yet it will come: thereadiness is all: since no man has aught of what heleaves, what is't to leave betimes?Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.This presence knows,And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'dWith sore distraction. What I have done,That might your nature, honour and exceptionRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.Sir, in this audience,Let my disclaiming from a purposed evilFree me so far in your most generous thoughts,That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,And hurt my brother.I am satisfied in nature,Whose motive, in this case, should stir me mostTo my revenge: but in my terms of honourI stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,Till by some elder masters, of known honour,I have a voice and precedent of peace,To keep my name ungored. But till that time,I do receive your offer'd love like love,And will not wrong it.I embrace it freely;And will this brother's wager frankly play.Give us the foils. Come on.Come, one for me.I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignoranceYour skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,Stick fiery off indeed.You mock me, sir.No, by this hand.Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,You know the wager?Very well, my lordYour grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.I do not fear it; I have seen you both:But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.This is too heavy, let me see another.This likes me well. These foils have all a length?Ay, my good lord.Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.If Hamlet give the first or second hit,Or quit in answer of the third exchange,Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;And in the cup an union shall he throw,Richer than that which four successive kingsIn Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,The trumpet to the cannoneer without,The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.Come on, sir.Come, my lord.One.No.Judgment.A hit, a very palpable hit.Well; again.Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;Here's to thy health.Give him the cup.I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.Another hit; what say you?A touch, a touch, I do confess.Our son shall win.He's fat, and scant of breath.Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.Good madam!Gertrude, do not drink.I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.[Aside]  It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.Come, let me wipe thy face.My lord, I'll hit him now.I do not think't.[Aside]  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;I pray you, pass with your best violence;I am afeard you make a wanton of me.Say you so? come on.Nothing, neither way.Have at you now!Part them; they are incensed.Nay, come, again.Look to the queen there, ho!They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?How is't, Laertes?Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.How does the queen?She swounds to see them bleed.No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;No medicine in the world can do thee good;In thee there is not half an hour of life;The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practiseHath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.The point!--envenom'd too!Then, venom, to thy work.Treason! treason!O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?Follow my mother.He is justly served;It is a poison temper'd by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,Nor thine on me.Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!You that look pale and tremble at this chance,That are but mutes or audience to this act,Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;Thou livest; report me and my cause arightTo the unsatisfied.Never believe it:I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:Here's yet some liquor left.As thou'rt a man,Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.O good Horatio, what a wounded name,Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!If thou didst ever hold me in thy heartAbsent thee from felicity awhile,And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,To tell my story.What warlike noise is this?Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,To the ambassadors of England givesThis warlike volley.O, I die, Horatio;The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:I cannot live to hear the news from England;But I do prophesy the election lightsOn Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence.Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!Why does the drum come hither?Where is this sight?What is it ye would see?If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,That thou so many princes at a shotSo bloodily hast struck?The sight is dismal;And our affairs from England come too late:The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:Where should we have our thanks?Not from his mouth,Had it the ability of life to thank you:He never gave commandment for their death.But since, so jump upon this bloody question,You from the Polack wars, and you from England,Are here arrived give order that these bodiesHigh on a stage be placed to the view;And let me speak to the yet unknowing worldHow these things came about: so shall you hearOf carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,And, in this upshot, purposes mistookFall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can ITruly deliver.Let us haste to hear it,And call the noblest to the audience.For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.Of that I shall have also cause to speak,And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;But let this same be presently perform'd,Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischanceOn plots and errors, happen.Let four captainsBear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;For he was likely, had he been put on,To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,The soldiers' music and the rites of warSpeak loudly for him.Take up the bodies: such a sight as thisBecomes the field, but here shows much amiss.Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
