We'll fight with him to-night.It may not be.You give him then the advantage.Not a whit.Why say you so? looks he not for supply?So do we.His is certain, ours is doubtful.Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.Do not, my lord.You do not counsel well:You speak it out of fear and cold heart.Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,And I dare well maintain it with my life,If well-respected honour bid me on,I hold as little counsel with weak fearAs you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:Let it be seen to-morrow in the battleWhich of us fears.Yea, or to-night.Content.To-night, say I.Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,Being men of such great leading as you are,That you foresee not what impedimentsDrag back our expedition: certain horseOf my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;And now their pride and mettle is asleep,Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,That not a horse is half the half of himself.So are the horses of the enemyIn general, journey-bated and brought low:The better part of ours are full of rest.The number of the king exceedeth ours:For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in.I come with gracious offers from the king,if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to GodYou were of our determination!Some of us love you well; and even those someEnvy your great deservings and good name,Because you are not of our quality,But stand against us like an enemy.And God defend but still I should stand so,So long as out of limit and true ruleYou stand against anointed majesty.But to my charge. The king hath sent to knowThe nature of your griefs, and whereuponYou conjure from the breast of civil peaceSuch bold hostility, teaching his duteous landAudacious cruelty. If that the kingHave any way your good deserts forgot,Which he confesseth to be manifold,He bids you name your griefs; and with all speedYou shall have your desires with interestAnd pardon absolute for yourself and theseHerein misled by your suggestion.The king is kind; and well we know the kingKnows at what time to promise, when to pay.My father and my uncle and myselfDid give him that same royalty he wears;And when he was not six and twenty strong,Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,My father gave him welcome to the shore;And when he heard him swear and vow to GodHe came but to be Duke of Lancaster,To sue his livery and beg his peace,With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,My father, in kind heart and pity moved,Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.Now when the lords and barons of the realmPerceived Northumberland did lean to him,The more and less came in with cap and knee;Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd himEven at the heels in golden multitudes.He presently, as greatness knows itself,Steps me a little higher than his vowMade to my father, while his blood was poor,Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;And now, forsooth, takes on him to reformSome certain edicts and some strait decreesThat lie too heavy on the commonwealth,Cries out upon abuses, seems to weepOver his country's wrongs; and by this face,This seeming brow of justice, did he winThe hearts of all that he did angle for;Proceeded further; cut me off the headsOf all the favourites that the absent kingIn deputation left behind him here,When he was personal in the Irish war.Tut, I came not to hear this.Then to the point.In short time after, he deposed the king;Soon after that, deprived him of his life;And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,Who is, if every owner were well placed,Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,There without ransom to lie forfeited;Disgraced me in my happy victories,Sought to entrap me by intelligence;Rated mine uncle from the council-board;In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,And in conclusion drove us to seek outThis head of safety; and withal to pryInto his title, the which we findToo indirect for long continuance.Shall I return this answer to the king?Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.Go to the king; and let there be impawn'dSome surety for a safe return again,And in the morning early shall my uncleBring him our purposes: and so farewell.I would you would accept of grace and love.And may be so we shall.Pray God you do.
