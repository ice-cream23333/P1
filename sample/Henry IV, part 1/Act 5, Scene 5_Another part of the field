Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,Pardon and terms of love to all of you?And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?Three knights upon our party slain to-day,A noble earl and many a creature elseHad been alive this hour,If like a Christian thou hadst truly borneBetwixt our armies true intelligence.What I have done my safety urged me to;And I embrace this fortune patiently,Since not to be avoided it falls on me.Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:Other offenders we will pause upon.How goes the field?The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he sawThe fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,The noble Percy slain, and all his menUpon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;And falling from a hill, he was so bruisedThat the pursuers took him. At my tentThe Douglas is; and I beseech your graceI may dispose of him.With all my heart.Then, brother John of Lancaster, to youThis honourable bounty shall belong:Go to the Douglas, and deliver himUp to his pleasure, ransomless and free:His valour shown upon our crests to-dayHath taught us how to cherish such high deedsEven in the bosom of our adversaries.I thank your grace for this high courtesy,Which I shall give away immediately.Then this remains, that we divide our power.You, son John, and my cousin WestmorelandTowards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,Meeting the cheque of such another day:And since this business so fair is done,Let us not leave till all our own be won.
