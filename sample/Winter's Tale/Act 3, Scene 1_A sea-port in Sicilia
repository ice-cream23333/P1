The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassingThe common praise it bears.I shall report,For most it caught me, the celestial habits,Methinks I so should term them, and the reverenceOf the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!How ceremonious, solemn and unearthlyIt was i' the offering!But of all, the burstAnd the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.That I was nothing.If the event o' the journeyProve as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,The time is worth the use on't.Great ApolloTurn all to the best! These proclamations,So forcing faults upon Hermione,I little like.The violent carriage of itWill clear or end the business: when the oracle,Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,Shall the contents discover, something rareEven then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!And gracious be the issue!
