Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,If fairings come thus plentifully in:A lady wall'd about with diamonds!Look you what I have from the loving king.Madame, came nothing else along with that?Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhymeAs would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.That was the way to make his godhead wax,For he hath been five thousand years a boy.Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;And so she died: had she been light, like you,Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:And so may you; for a light heart lives long.What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?A light condition in a beauty dark.We need more light to find your meaning out.You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.So do not you, for you are a light wench.Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.But Rosaline, you have a favour too:Who sent it? and what is it?I would you knew:An if my face were but as fair as yours,My favour were as great; be witness this.Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,I were the fairest goddess on the ground:I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!Any thing like?Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.Fair as a text B in a copy-book.'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,My red dominical, my golden letter:O, that your face were not so full of O's!A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?Madam, this glove.Did he not send you twain?Yes, madam, and moreoverSome thousand verses of a faithful lover,A huge translation of hypocrisy,Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:The letter is too long by half a mile.I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heartThe chain were longer and the letter short?Ay, or I would these hands might never part.We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:O that I knew he were but in by the week!How I would make him fawn and beg and seekAnd wait the season and observe the timesAnd spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymesAnd shape his service wholly to my hestsAnd make him proud to make me proud that jests!So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his stateThat he should be my fool and I his fate.None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of schoolAnd wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.The blood of youth burns not with such excessAs gravity's revolt to wantonness.Folly in fools bears not so strong a noteAs foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;Since all the power thereof it doth applyTo prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?Thy news Boyet?Prepare, madam, prepare!Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted areAgainst your peace: Love doth approach disguised,Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are theyThat charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.Under the cool shade of a sycamoreI thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,Toward that shade I might behold addrestThe king and his companions: warilyI stole into a neighbour thicket by,And overheard what you shall overhear,That, by and by, disguised they will be here.Their herald is a pretty knavish page,That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:Action and accent did they teach him there;'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'And ever and anon they made a doubtPresence majestical would put him out,'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and sworeA better speech was never spoke before;Another, with his finger and his thumb,Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.With that, they all did tumble on the ground,With such a zealous laughter, so profound,That in this spleen ridiculous appears,To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.But what, but what, come they to visit us?They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;And every one his love-feat will advanceUnto his several mistress, which they'll knowBy favours several which they did bestow.And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;And not a man of them shall have the grace,Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,And then the king will court thee for his dear;Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.And change your favours too; so shall your lovesWoo contrary, deceived by these removes.Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.But in this changing what is your intent?The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:They do it but in mocking merriment;And mock for mock is only my intent.Their several counsels they unbosom shallTo loves mistook, and so be mock'd withalUpon the next occasion that we meet,With visages displayed, to talk and greet.But shall we dance, if they desire to't?No, to the death, we will not move a foot;Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,And quite divorce his memory from his part.Therefore I do it; and I make no doubtThe rest will ne'er come in, if he be outThere's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:So shall we stay, mocking intended game,And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.A holy parcel of the fairest dames.That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views![Aside to MOTH]  Their eyes, villain, their eyes!That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--True; out indeed.Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafeNot to behold--[Aside to MOTH]  Once to behold, rogue.Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,--with your sun-beamed eyes--They will not answer to that epithet;You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'They do not mark me, and that brings me out.Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:That some plain man recount their purposesKnow what they would.What would you with the princess?Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.What would they, say they?Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.She says, you have it, and you may be gone.Say to her, we have measured many milesTo tread a measure with her on this grass.They say, that they have measured many a mileTo tread a measure with you on this grass.It is not so. Ask them how many inchesIs in one mile: if they have measured many,The measure then of one is easily told.If to come hither you have measured miles,And many miles, the princess bids you tellHow many inches doth fill up one mile.Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.She hears herself.How many weary steps,Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,Are number'd in the travel of one mile?We number nothing that we spend for you:Our duty is so rich, so infinite,That we may do it still without accompt.Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,That we, like savages, may worship it.My face is but a moon, and clouded too.Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.Our ears vouchsafe it.But your legs should do it.Since you are strangers and come here by chance,We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.Why take we hands, then?Only to part friends:Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.More measure of this measure; be not nice.We can afford no more at such a price.Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?Your absence only.That can never be.Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;Twice to your visor, and half once to you.If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.In private, then.I am best pleased with that.White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!There's half-a-dozen sweets.Seventh sweet, adieu:Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.One word in secret.Let it not be sweet.Thou grievest my gall.Gall! bitter.Therefore meet.Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?Name it.Fair lady,--Say you so? Fair lord,--Take that for your fair lady.Please it you,As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.What, was your vizard made without a tongue?I know the reason, lady, why you ask.O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.You have a double tongue within your mask,And would afford my speechless vizard half.Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?A calf, fair lady!No, a fair lord calf.Let's part the word.No, I'll not be your halfTake all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.One word in private with you, ere I die.Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.The tongues of mocking wenches are as keenAs is the razor's edge invisible,Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,Above the sense of sense; so sensibleSeemeth their conference; their conceits have wingsFleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.O, they were all in lamentable cases!The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.Biron did swear himself out of all suit.Dumain was at my service, and his sword:No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;And trow you what he called me?Qualm, perhaps.Yes, in good faith.Go, sickness as thou art!Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.And Longaville was for my service born.Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:Immediately they will again be hereIn their own shapes; for it can never beThey will digest this harsh indignity.Will they return?They will, they will, God knows,And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,If they return in their own shapes to woo?Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:Let us complain to them what fools were here,Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;And wonder what they were and to what endTheir shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'dAnd their rough carriage so ridiculous,Should be presented at our tent to us.Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?Gone to her tent. Please it your majestyCommand me any service to her thither?That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,And utters it again when God doth please:He is wit's pedler, and retails his waresAt wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,Have not the grace to grace it with such show.This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is heThat kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,That, when he plays at tables, chides the diceIn honourable terms: nay, he can singA mean most meanly; and in usheringMend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:This is the flower that smiles on every one,To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;And consciences, that will not die in debt,Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,That put Armado's page out of his part!See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thouTill this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.Construe my speeches better, if you may.Then wish me better; I will give you leave.We came to visit you, and purpose nowTo lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:The virtue of your eye must break my oath.You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.Now by my maiden honour, yet as pureAs the unsullied lily, I protest,A world of torments though I should endure,I would not yield to be your house's guest;So much I hate a breaking cause to beOf heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.O, you have lived in desolation here,Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:A mess of Russians left us but of late.How, madam! Russians!Ay, in truth, my lord;Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:My lady, to the manner of the days,In courtesy gives undeserving praise.We four indeed confronted were with fourIn Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,They did not bless us with one happy word.I dare not call them fools; but this I think,When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,By light we lose light: your capacityIs of that nature that to your huge storeWise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--I am a fool, and full of poverty.But that you take what doth to you belong,It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.O, I am yours, and all that I possess!All the fool mine?I cannot give you less.Which of the vizards was it that you wore?Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?There, then, that vizard; that superfluous caseThat hid the worse and show'd the better face.We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.Let us confess and turn it to a jest.Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.Can any face of brass hold longer out?lady, dart thy skill at me;Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;And I will wish thee never more to dance,Nor never more in Russian habit wait.O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,Nor never come in vizard to my friend,Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,Figures pedantical; these summer-fliesHave blown me full of maggot ostentation:I do forswear them; and I here protest,By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'dIn russet yeas and honest kersey noes:And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.Sans sans, I pray you.Yet I have a trickOf the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;They are infected; in their hearts it lies;They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;These lords are visited; you are not free,For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.It is not so; for how can this be true,That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?Peace! for I will not have to do with you.Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgressionSome fair excuse.The fairest is confession.Were not you here but even now disguised?Madam, I was.And were you well advised?I was, fair madam.When you then were here,What did you whisper in your lady's ear?That more than all the world I did respect her.When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.Upon mine honour, no.Peace, peace! forbear:Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,What did the Russian whisper in your ear?Madam, he swore that he did hold me dearAs precious eyesight, and did value meAbove this world; adding thereto moreoverThat he would wed me, or else die my lover.God give thee joy of him! the noble lordMost honourably doth unhold his word.What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,I never swore this lady such an oath.By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.My faith and this the princess I did give:I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.What, will you have me, or your pearl again?Neither of either; I remit both twain.I see the trick on't: here was a consent,Knowing aforehand of our merriment,To dash it like a Christmas comedy:Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trickTo make my lady laugh when she's disposed,Told our intents before; which once disclosed,The ladies did change favours: and then we,Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.Now, to our perjury to add more terror,We are again forsworn, in will and error.Much upon this it is: and might not youForestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,And laugh upon the apple of her eye?And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.You leer upon me, do you? there's an eyeWounds like a leaden sword.Full merrilyHath this brave manage, this career, been run.Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.O Lord, sir, they would knowWhether the three Worthies shall come in or no.What, are there but three?No, sir; but it is vara fine,For every one pursents three.And three times thrice is nine.Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we knowwhat we know:I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--Is not nine.Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your livingby reckoning, sir.How much is it?O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mineown part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one manin one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.Art thou one of the Worthies?It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion theGreat: for mine own part, I know not the degree ofthe Worthy, but I am to stand for him.Go, bid them prepare.We will turn it finely off, sir; we will takesome care.Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policyTo have one show worse than the king's and his company.I say they shall not come.Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:That sport best pleases that doth least know how:Where zeal strives to content, and the contentsDies in the zeal of that which it presents:Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,When great things labouring perish in their birth.A right description of our sport, my lord.DONAnointed, I implore so much expense of thy royalsweet breath as will utter a brace of words.Doth this man serve God?Why ask you?He speaks not like a man of God's making.DONThat is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,I protest, the schoolmaster is exceedingfantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but wewill put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. Hepresents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey theGreat; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page,Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And ifthese four Worthies in their first show thrive,These four will change habits, and present the other five.There is five in the first show.You are deceived; 'tis not so.The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fooland the boy:--Abate throw at novum, and the whole world againCannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.I Pompey am,--You lie, you are not he.I Pompey am,--With libbard's head on knee.Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friendswith thee.I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--The Great.It is, 'Great,' sir:--Pompey surnamed the Great;That oft in field, with targe and shield, did makemy foe to sweat:And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.Great thanks, great Pompey.'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: Imade a little fault in 'Great.'My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.When in the world I lived, I was the world'scommander;By east, west, north, and south, I spread myconquering might:My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,--Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.When in the world I lived, I was the world'scommander,--Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.Pompey the Great,--Your servant, and Costard.Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.[To SIR NATHANIEL]  O, sir, you have overthrownAlisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out ofthe painted cloth for this: your lion, that holdshis poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be givento Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander.There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; anhonest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is amarvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very goodbowler: but, for Alisander,--alas, you see how'tis,--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthiesa-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.Great Hercules is presented by this imp,Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis;And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.Quoniam he seemeth in minority,Ergo I come with this apology.Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.Judas I am,--A Judas!Not Iscariot, sir.Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?Judas I am,--The more shame for you, Judas.What mean you, sir?To make Judas hang himself.Begin, sir; you are my elder.Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.I will not be put out of countenance.Because thou hast no face.What is this?A cittern-head.The head of a bodkin.A Death's face in a ring.The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.The pommel of Caesar's falchion.The carved-bone face on a flask.Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.Ay, and in a brooch of lead.Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.You have put me out of countenance.False; we have given thee faces.But you have out-faced them all.An thou wert a lion, we would do so.Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?For the latter end of his name.For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.But is this Hector?I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.His leg is too big for Hector's.More calf, certain.No; he is best endued in the small.This cannot be Hector.He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.DONThe armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,Gave Hector a gift,--A gilt nutmeg.A lemon.Stuck with cloves.No, cloven.DONPeace!--The armipotent Mars, of lances the almightyGave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yeaFrom morn till night, out of his pavilion.I am that flower,--That mint.That columbine.DONSweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.DONThe sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,he was a man. But I will forward with my device.Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.DONI do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.[Aside to DUMAIN]  Loves her by the foot,--[Aside to BOYET]  He may not by the yard.DONThis Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; sheis two months on her way.DONWhat meanest thou?Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poorwench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags inher belly already: tis yours.DONDost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shaltdie.Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that isquick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead byhim.Most rare Pompey!Renowned Pompey!Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!Pompey the Huge!Hector trembles.Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir themon! stir them on!Hector will challenge him.Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than willsup a flea.DONBy the north pole, I do challenge thee.I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,let me borrow my arms again.Room for the incensed Worthies!I'll do it in my shirt.Most resolute Pompey!Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do younot see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What meanyou? You will lose your reputation.DONGentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combatin my shirt.You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.DONSweet bloods, I both may and will.What reason have you for't?DONThe naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I gowoolward for penance.True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want oflinen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none buta dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears nexthis heart for a favour.God save you, madam!Welcome, Mercade;But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.I am sorry, madam; for the news I bringIs heavy in my tongue. The king your father--Dead, for my life!Even so; my tale is told.Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.DONFor mine own part, I breathe free breath. I haveseen the day of wrong through the little hole ofdiscretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.How fares your majesty?Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafeIn your rich wisdom to excuse or hideThe liberal opposition of our spirits,If over-boldly we have borne ourselvesIn the converse of breath: your gentlenessWas guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:Excuse me so, coming too short of thanksFor my great suit so easily obtain'd.The extreme parts of time extremely formsAll causes to the purpose of his speed,And often at his very loose decidesThat which long process could not arbitrate:And though the mourning brow of progenyForbid the smiling courtesy of loveThe holy suit which fain it would convince,Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,Let not the cloud of sorrow justle itFrom what it purposed; since, to wail friends lostIs not by much so wholesome-profitableAs to rejoice at friends but newly found.I understand you not: my griefs are double.Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;And by these badges understand the king.For your fair sakes have we neglected time,Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humoursEven to the opposed end of our intents:And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--As love is full of unbefitting strains,All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,Varying in subjects as the eye doth rollTo every varied object in his glance:Which parti-coated presence of loose lovePut on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,Our love being yours, the error that love makesIs likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,By being once false for ever to be trueTo those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.We have received your letters full of love;Your favours, the ambassadors of love;And, in our maiden council, rated themAt courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,As bombast and as lining to the time:But more devout than this in our respectsHave we not been; and therefore met your lovesIn their own fashion, like a merriment.Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.So did our looks.We did not quote them so.Now, at the latest minute of the hour,Grant us your loves.A time, methinks, too shortTo make a world-without-end bargain in.No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:If for my love, as there is no such cause,You will do aught, this shall you do for me:Your oath I will not trust; but go with speedTo some forlorn and naked hermitage,Remote from all the pleasures of the world;There stay until the twelve celestial signsHave brought about the annual reckoning.If this austere insociable lifeChange not your offer made in heat of blood;If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weedsNip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,But that it bear this trial and last love;Then, at the expiration of the year,Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,And, by this virgin palm now kissing thineI will be thine; and till that instant shutMy woeful self up in a mourning house,Raining the tears of lamentationFor the remembrance of my father's death.If this thou do deny, let our hands part,Neither entitled in the other's heart.If this, or more than this, I would deny,To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?A beard, fair health, and honesty;With three-fold love I wish you all these three.O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a dayI'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:Come when the king doth to my lady come;Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.What says Maria?At the twelvemonth's endI'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.The liker you; few taller are so young.Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,What humble suit attends thy answer there:Impose some service on me for thy love.Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,Before I saw you; and the world's large tongueProclaims you for a man replete with mocks,Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,Which you on all estates will executeThat lie within the mercy of your wit.To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,And therewithal to win me, if you please,Without the which I am not to be won,You shall this twelvemonth term from day to dayVisit the speechless sick and still converseWith groaning wretches; and your task shall be,With all the fierce endeavor of your witTo enforce the pained impotent to smile.To move wild laughter in the throat of death?It cannot be; it is impossible:Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,Whose influence is begot of that loose graceWhich shallow laughing hearers give to fools:A jest's prosperity lies in the earOf him that hears it, never in the tongueOf him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,And I will have you and that fault withal;But if they will not, throw away that spirit,And I shall find you empty of that fault,Right joyful of your reformation.A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.[To FERDINAND]  Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.No, madam; we will bring you on your way.Our wooing doth not end like an old play;Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesyMight well have made our sport a comedy.Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,And then 'twill end.That's too long for a play.DONSweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--Was not that Hector?The worthy knight of Troy.DONI will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I ama votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold theplough for her sweet love three years. But, mostesteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue thatthe two learned men have compiled in praise of theowl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in theend of our show.Call them forth quickly; we will do so.DONHolla! approach.This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;the one maintained by the owl, the other by thecuckoo. Ver, begin.SPRING.When daisies pied and violets blueAnd lady-smocks all silver-whiteAnd cuckoo-buds of yellow hueDo paint the meadows with delight,The cuckoo then, on every tree,Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,Unpleasing to a married ear!When shepherds pipe on oaten strawsAnd merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,And maidens bleach their summer smocksThe cuckoo then, on every tree,Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,Unpleasing to a married ear!WINTER.When icicles hang by the wallAnd Dick the shepherd blows his nailAnd Tom bears logs into the hallAnd milk comes frozen home in pail,When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;Tu-who, a merry note,While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.When all aloud the wind doth blowAnd coughing drowns the parson's sawAnd birds sit brooding in the snowAnd Marian's nose looks red and raw,When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;Tu-who, a merry note,While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.DONThe words of Mercury are harsh after the songs ofApollo. You that way: we this way.
