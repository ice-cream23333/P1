Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?I well allow the occasion of our arms;But gladly would be better satisfiedHow in our means we should advance ourselvesTo look with forehead bold and big enoughUpon the power and puissance of the king.Our present musters grow upon the fileTo five and twenty thousand men of choice;And our supplies live largely in the hopeOf great Northumberland, whose bosom burnsWith an incensed fire of injuries.The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;Whether our present five and twenty thousandMay hold up head without Northumberland?With him, we may.Yea, marry, there's the point:But if without him we be thought too feeble,My judgment is, we should not step too farTill we had his assistance by the hand;For in a theme so bloody-faced as thisConjecture, expectation, and surmiseOf aids incertain should not be admitted.'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeedIt was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,Eating the air on promise of supply,Flattering himself in project of a powerMuch smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:And so, with great imaginationProper to madmen, led his powers to deathAnd winking leap'd into destruction.But, by your leave, it never yet did hurtTo lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.Yes, if this present quality of war,Indeed the instant action: a cause on footLives so in hope as in an early springWe see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,Hope gives not so much warrant as despairThat frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,We first survey the plot, then draw the model;And when we see the figure of the house,Then must we rate the cost of the erection;Which if we find outweighs ability,What do we then but draw anew the modelIn fewer offices, or at last desistTo build at all? Much more, in this great work,Which is almost to pluck a kingdom downAnd set another up, should we surveyThe plot of situation and the model,Consent upon a sure foundation,Question surveyors, know our own estate,How able such a work to undergo,To weigh against his opposite; or elseWe fortify in paper and in figures,Using the names of men instead of men:Like one that draws the model of a houseBeyond his power to build it; who, half through,Gives o'er and leaves his part-created costA naked subject to the weeping cloudsAnd waste for churlish winter's tyranny.Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,Should be still-born, and that we now possess'dThe utmost man of expectation,I think we are a body strong enough,Even as we are, to equal with the king.What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.For his divisions, as the times do brawl,Are in three heads: one power against the French,And one against Glendower; perforce a thirdMust take up us: so is the unfirm kingIn three divided; and his coffers soundWith hollow poverty and emptiness.That he should draw his several strengths togetherAnd come against us in full puissance,Need not be dreaded.If he should do so,He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and WelshBaying him at the heels: never fear that.Who is it like should lead his forces hither?The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:But who is substituted 'gainst the French,I have no certain notice.Let us on,And publish the occasion of our arms.The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:An habitation giddy and unsureHath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.O thou fond many, with what loud applauseDidst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorgeThy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,And howl'st to find it. What trust is inthese times?They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,Are now become enamour'd on his grave:Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly headWhen through proud London he came sighing onAfter the admired heels of Bolingbroke,Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!Past and to come seems best; things present worst.Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.
