You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.My Lord of York, it better show'd with youWhen that your flock, assembled by the bell,Encircled you to hear with reverenceYour exposition on the holy textThan now to see you here an iron man,Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,Turning the word to sword and life to death.That man that sits within a monarch's heart,And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,Would he abuse the countenance of the king,Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroochIn shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,It is even so. Who hath not heard it spokenHow deep you were within the books of God?To us the speaker in his parliament;To us the imagined voice of God himself;The very opener and intelligencerBetween the grace, the sanctities of heavenAnd our dull workings. O, who shall believeBut you misuse the reverence of your place,Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,As a false favourite doth his prince's name,In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,Under the counterfeited zeal of God,The subjects of his substitute, my father,And both against the peace of heaven and himHave here up-swarm'd them.Good my Lord of Lancaster,I am not here against your father's peace;But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,To hold our safety up. I sent your graceThe parcels and particulars of our grief,The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleepWith grant of our most just and right desires,And true obedience, of this madness cured,Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.If not, we ready are to try our fortunesTo the last man.And though we here fall down,We have supplies to second our attempt:If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;And so success of mischief shall be bornAnd heir from heir shall hold this quarrel upWhiles England shall have generation.You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,To sound the bottom of the after-times.Pleaseth your grace to answer them directlyHow far forth you do like their articles.I like them all, and do allow them well,And swear here, by the honour of my blood,My father's purposes have been mistook,And some about him have too lavishlyWrested his meaning and authority.My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,Discharge your powers unto their several counties,As we will ours: and here between the armiesLet's drink together friendly and embrace,That all their eyes may bear those tokens homeOf our restored love and amity.I take your princely word for these redresses.I give it you, and will maintain my word:And thereupon I drink unto your grace.Go, captain, and deliver to the armyThis news of peace: let them have pay, and part:I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what painsI have bestow'd to breed this present peace,You would drink freely: but my love to yeShall show itself more openly hereafter.I do not doubt you.I am glad of it.Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.You wish me health in very happy season;For I am, on the sudden, something ill.Against ill chances men are ever merry;But heaviness foreruns the good event.Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrowServes to say thus, 'some good thing comesto-morrow.'Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.So much the worse, if your own rule be true.The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!This had been cheerful after victory.A peace is of the nature of a conquest;For then both parties nobly are subdued,And neither party loser.Go, my lord,And let our army be discharged too.And, good my lord, so please you, let our trainsMarch, by us, that we may peruse the menWe should have coped withal.Go, good Lord Hastings,And, ere they be dismissed, let them march by.I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?The leaders, having charge from you to stand,Will not go off until they hear you speak.They know their duties.My lord, our army is dispersed already;Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their coursesEast, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the whichI do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,Of capitol treason I attach you both.Is this proceeding just and honourable?Is your assembly so?Will you thus break your faith?I pawn'd thee none:I promised you redress of these same grievancesWhereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,I will perform with a most Christian care.But for you, rebels, look to taste the dueMeet for rebellion and such acts as yours.Most shallowly did you these arms commence,Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.Some guard these traitors to the block of death,Treason's true bed and yielder up of breath.
