Good night to you.Well, sir, good night.Soldiers, have careful watch.And you. Good night, good night.Here we: and if to-morrowOur navy thrive, I have an absolute hopeOur landmen will stand up.'Tis a brave army,And full of purpose.Peace! what noise?List, list!Hark!Music i' the air.Under the earth.It signs well, does it not?No.Peace, I say!What should this mean?'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,Now leaves him.Walk; let's see if other watchmenDo hear what we do?How now, masters![Speaking together]  How now!How now! do you hear this?Ay; is't not strange?Do you hear, masters? do you hear?Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;Let's see how it will give off.Content. 'Tis strange.
