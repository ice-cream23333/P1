Give me some music; music, moody foodOf us that trade in love.The music, ho!Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.As well a woman with an eunuch play'dAs with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?As well as I can, madam.And when good will is show'd, though't cometoo short,The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,My music playing far off, I will betrayTawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierceTheir slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,I'll think them every one an Antony,And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.''Twas merry whenYou wager'd on your angling; when your diverDid hang a salt-fish on his hook, which heWith fervency drew up.That time,--O times!--I laugh'd him out of patience; and that nightI laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilstI wore his sword Philippan.O, from ItalyRam thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,That long time have been barren.Madam, madam,--Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,If thou so yield him, there is gold, and hereMy bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kingsHave lipp'd, and trembled kissing.First, madam, he is well.Why, there's more gold.But, sirrah, mark, we useTo say the dead are well: bring it to that,The gold I give thee will I melt and pourDown thy ill-uttering throat.Good madam, hear me.Well, go to, I will;But there's no goodness in thy face: if AntonyBe free and healthful,--so tart a favourTo trumpet such good tidings! If not well,Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,Not like a formal man.Will't please you hear me?I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hailRich pearls upon thee.Madam, he's well.Well said.And friends with Caesar.Thou'rt an honest man.Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.Make thee a fortune from me.But yet, madam,--I do not like 'But yet,' it does allayThe good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forthSome monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.Free, madam! no; I made no such report:He's bound unto Octavia.For what good turn?For the best turn i' the bed.I am pale, Charmian.Madam, he's married to Octavia.The most infectious pestilence upon thee!Good madam, patience.What say you? Hence,Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyesLike balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,Smarting in lingering pickle.Gracious madam,I that do bring the news made not the match.Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadstShall make thy peace for moving me to rage;And I will boot thee with what gift besideThy modesty can beg.He's married, madam.Rogue, thou hast lived too long.Nay, then I'll run.What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:The man is innocent.Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creaturesTurn all to serpents! Call the slave again:Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.He is afeard to come.I will not hurt him.These hands do lack nobility, that they strikeA meaner than myself; since I myselfHave given myself the cause.Come hither, sir.Though it be honest, it is never goodTo bring bad news: give to a gracious message.An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tellThemselves when they be felt.I have done my duty.Is he married?I cannot hate thee worser than I do,If thou again say 'Yes.'He's married, madam.The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?Should I lie, madam?O, I would thou didst,So half my Egypt were submerged and madeA cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to meThou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?I crave your highness' pardon.He is married?Take no offence that I would not offend you:To punish me for what you make me do.Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:The merchandise which thou hast brought from RomeAre all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,And be undone by 'em!Good your highness, patience.In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.Many times, madam.I am paid for't now.Lead me from hence:I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid himReport the feature of Octavia, her years,Her inclination, let him not leave outThe colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,The other way's a Mars. Bid you AlexasBring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.
