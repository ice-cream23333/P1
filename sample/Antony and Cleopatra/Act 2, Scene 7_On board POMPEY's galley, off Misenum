Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants areill-rooted already: the least wind i' the worldwill blow them down.Lepidus is high-coloured.They have made him drink alms-drink.As they pinch one another by the disposition, hecries out 'No more;' reconciles them to hisentreaty, and himself to the drink.But it raises the greater war between him andhis discretion.Why, this is to have a name in great men'sfellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will dome no service as a partisan I could not heave.To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seento move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,which pitifully disaster the cheeks.[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR]  Thus do they, sir: they takethe flow o' the NileBy certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearthOr foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsmanUpon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,And shortly comes to harvest.You've strange serpents there.Ay, Lepidus.Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by theoperation of your sun: so is your crocodile.They are so.Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'pyramises are very goodly things; withoutcontradiction, I have heard that.[Aside to POMPEY]  Pompey, a word.[Aside to MENAS]                 Say in mine ear:what is't?[Aside to POMPEY]  Forsake thy seat, I do beseechthee, captain,And hear me speak a word.[Aside to MENAS]  Forbear me till anon.This wine for Lepidus!What manner o' thing is your crocodile?It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broadas it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,and moves with its own organs: it lives by thatwhich nourisheth it; and the elements once out ofit, it transmigrates.What colour is it of?Of it own colour too.'Tis a strange serpent.'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.Will this description satisfy him?With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is avery epicure.[Aside to MENAS]  Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me ofthat? away!Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?[Aside to POMPEY]  If for the sake of merit thouwilt hear me,Rise from thy stool.[Aside to MENAS]  I think thou'rt mad.The matter?I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?Be jolly, lords.These quick-sands, Lepidus,Keep off them, for you sink.Wilt thou be lord of all the world?What say'st thou?Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.How should that be?But entertain it,And, though thou think me poor, I am the manWill give thee all the world.Hast thou drunk well?Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.Show me which way.These three world-sharers, these competitors,Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:All there is thine.Ah, this thou shouldst have done,And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongueHath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,I should have found it afterwards well done;But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.[Aside]  For this,I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,Shall never find it more.This health to Lepidus!Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.Here's to thee, Menas!Enobarbus, welcome!Fill till the cup be hid.There's a strong fellow, Menas.Why?A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'stnot?The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,That it might go on wheels!Drink thou; increase the reels.Come.This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?Here is to Caesar!I could well forbear't.It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,And it grows fouler.Be a child o' the time.Possess it, I'll make answer:But I had rather fast from all four daysThan drink so much in one.Ha, my brave emperor!Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,And celebrate our drink?Let's ha't, good soldier.Come, let's all take hands,Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our senseIn soft and delicate Lethe.All take hands.Make battery to our ears with the loud music:The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;The holding every man shall bear as loudAs his strong sides can volley.THE SONG.Come, thou monarch of the vine,Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!In thy fats our cares be drown'd,With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:Cup us, till the world go round,Cup us, till the world go round!What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,Let me request you off: our graver businessFrowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong EnobarbIs weaker than the wine; and mine own tongueSplits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almostAntick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.Good Antony, your hand.I'll try you on the shore.And shall, sir; give's your hand.O Antony,You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.Come, down into the boat.Take heed you fall not.Menas, I'll not on shore.No, to my cabin.These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewellTo these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!Ho! says a' There's my cap.Ho! Noble captain, come.
