Where is the fellow?Half afeard to come.Go to, go to.Come hither, sir.Good majesty,Herod of Jewry dare not look upon youBut when you are well pleased.That Herod's headI'll have: but how, when Antony is goneThrough whom I might command it? Come thou near.Most gracious majesty,--Didst thou behold Octavia?Ay, dread queen.Where?Madam, in Rome;I look'd her in the face, and saw her ledBetween her brother and Mark Antony.Is she as tall as me?She is not, madam.Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.That's not so good: he cannot like her long.Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!What majesty is in her gait? Remember,If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.She creeps:Her motion and her station are as one;She shows a body rather than a life,A statue than a breather.Is this certain?Or I have no observance.Three in EgyptCannot make better note.He's very knowing;I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:The fellow has good judgment.Excellent.Guess at her years, I prithee.Madam,She was a widow,--Widow! Charmian, hark.And I do think she's thirty.Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?Round even to faultiness.For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.Her hair, what colour?Brown, madam: and her foreheadAs low as she would wish it.There's gold for thee.Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:I will employ thee back again; I find theeMost fit for business: go make thee ready;Our letters are prepared.A proper man.Indeed, he is so: I repent me muchThat so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,This creature's no such thing.Nothing, madam.The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,And serving you so long!I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to meWhere I will write. All may be well enough.I warrant you, madam.
