Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!Come good fellow, put mine iron on:If fortune be not ours to-day, it isBecause we brave her: come.Nay, I'll help too.What's this for?Ah, let be, let be! thou artThe armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.Well, well;We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?Go put on thy defences.Briefly, sir.Is not this buckled well?Rarely, rarely:He that unbuckles this, till we do pleaseTo daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squireMore tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'stThe royal occupation! thou shouldst seeA workman in't.Good morrow to thee; welcome:Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:To business that we love we rise betime,And go to't with delight.A thousand, sir,Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,And at the port expect you.The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.Good morrow, general.'Tis well blown, lads:This morning, like the spirit of a youthThat means to be of note, begins betimes.So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeableAnd worthy shameful cheque it were, to standOn more mechanic compliment; I'll leave theeNow, like a man of steel. You that will fight,Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.Please you, retire to your chamber.Lead me.He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar mightDetermine this great war in single fight!Then Antony,--but now--Well, on.
