He will not fight with me, Domitius.No.Why should he not?He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,He is twenty men to one.To-morrow, soldier,By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,Or bathe my dying honour in the bloodShall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'Well said; come on.Call forth my household servants: let's to-nightBe bounteous at our meal.Give me thy hand,Thou hast been rightly honest;--so hast thou;--Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you have served me well,And kings have been your fellows.[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What means this?[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  'Tis one of those oddtricks which sorrow shootsOut of the mind.And thou art honest too.I wish I could be made so many men,And all of you clapp'd up together inAn Antony, that I might do you serviceSo good as you have done.The gods forbid!Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:Scant not my cups; and make as much of meAs when mine empire was your fellow too,And suffer'd my command.[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What does he mean?[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  To make his followers weep.Tend me to-night;May be it is the period of your duty:Haply you shall not see me more; or if,A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrowYou'll serve another master. I look on youAs one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,I turn you not away; but, like a masterMarried to your good service, stay till death:Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,And the gods yield you for't!What mean you, sir,To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,Transform us not to women.Ho, ho, ho!Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!Grace grow where those drops fall!My hearty friends,You take me in too dolorous a sense;For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire youTo burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead youWhere rather I'll expect victorious lifeThan death and honour. Let's to supper, come,And drown consideration.
