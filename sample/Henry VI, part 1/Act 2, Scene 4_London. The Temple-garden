RICHARDGreat lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?Dare no man answer in a case of truth?Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;The garden here is more convenient.RICHARDThen say at once if I maintain'd the truth;Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?Faith, I have been a truant in the law,And never yet could frame my will to it;And therefore frame the law unto my will.Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;Between two blades, which bears the better temper:Between two horses, which doth bear him best;Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.RICHARDTut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:The truth appears so naked on my sideThat any purblind eye may find it out.And on my side it is so well apparell'd,So clear, so shining and so evidentThat it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.RICHARDSince you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:Let him that is a true-born gentlemanAnd stands upon the honour of his birth,If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,But dare maintain the party of the truth,Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.I love no colours, and without all colourOf base insinuating flatteryI pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.I pluck this red rose with young SomersetAnd say withal I think he held the right.Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,Till you conclude that he upon whose sideThe fewest roses are cropp'd from the treeShall yield the other in the right opinion.Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.RICHARDAnd I.Then for the truth and plainness of the case.I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,Giving my verdict on the white rose side.Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose redAnd fall on my side so, against your will.If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurtAnd keep me on the side where still I am.Well, well, come on: who else?Unless my study and my books be false,The argument you held was wrong in you:In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.RICHARDNow, Somerset, where is your argument?Here in my scabbard, meditating thatShall dye your white rose in a bloody red.RICHARDMeantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;For pale they look with fear, as witnessingThe truth on our side.No, Plantagenet,'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeksBlush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.RICHARDHath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?RICHARDAy, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,That shall maintain what I have said is true,Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.RICHARDNow, by this maiden blossom in my hand,I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.RICHARDProud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.Away, away, good William de la Pole!We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset;His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,Third son to the third Edward King of England:Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?RICHARDHe bears him on the place's privilege,Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.By him that made me, I'll maintain my wordsOn any plot of ground in Christendom.Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,For treason executed in our late king's days?And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.RICHARDMy father was attached, not attainted,Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.For your partaker Pole and you yourself,I'll note you in my book of memory,To scourge you for this apprehension:Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;And know us by these colours for thy foes,For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.RICHARDAnd, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,Will I for ever and my faction wear,Until it wither with me to my graveOr flourish to the height of my degree.Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!And so farewell until I meet thee next.Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard.RICHARDHow I am braved and must perforce endure it!This blot that they object against your houseShall be wiped out in the next parliamentCall'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;And if thou be not then created York,I will not live to be accounted Warwick.Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,Against proud Somerset and William Pole,Will I upon thy party wear this rose:And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,Shall send between the red rose and the whiteA thousand souls to death and deadly night.RICHARDGood Master Vernon, I am bound to you,That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.In your behalf still will I wear the same.And so will I.RICHARDThanks, gentle sir.Come, let us four to dinner: I dare sayThis quarrel will drink blood another day.
