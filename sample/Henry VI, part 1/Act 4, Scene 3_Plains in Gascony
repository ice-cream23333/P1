Are not the speedy scouts return'd again,That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?They are return'd, my lord, and give it outThat he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along,By your espials were discoveredTwo mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.A plague upon that villain Somerset,That thus delays my promised supplyOf horsemen, that were levied for this siege!Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,And I am lowted by a traitor villainAnd cannot help the noble chevalier:God comfort him in this necessity!If he miscarry, farewell wars in France.Thou princely leader of our English strength,Never so needful on the earth of France,Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,Who now is girdled with a waist of ironAnd hemm'd about with grim destruction:To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour.O God, that Somerset, who in proud heartDoth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!So should we save a valiant gentlemanBy forfeiting a traitor and a coward.Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get;All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;And on his son young John, who two hours sinceI met in travel toward his warlike father!This seven years did not Talbot see his son;And now they meet where both their lives are done.Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot haveTo bid his young son welcome to his grave?Away! vexation almost stops my breath,That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death.Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away,'Long all of Somerset and his delay.Thus, while the vulture of seditionFeeds in the bosom of such great commanders,Sleeping neglection doth betray to lossThe conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,That ever living man of memory,Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,Lives, honours, lands and all hurry to loss.
