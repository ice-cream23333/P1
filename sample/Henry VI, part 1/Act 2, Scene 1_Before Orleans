Sirs, take your places and be vigilant:If any noise or soldier you perceiveNear to the walls, by some apparent signLet us have knowledge at the court of guard.Sergeant, you shall.Thus are poor servitors,When others sleep upon their quiet beds,Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold.Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,By whose approach the regions of Artois,Wallon and Picardy are friends to us,This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,Having all day caroused and banqueted:Embrace we then this opportunityAs fitting best to quittance their deceitContrived by art and baleful sorcery.Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,To join with witches and the help of hell!Traitors have never other company.But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?A maid, they say.A maid! and be so martial!Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,If underneath the standard of the FrenchShe carry armour as she hath begun.Well, let them practise and converse with spirits:God is our fortress, in whose conquering nameLet us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee.Not all together: better far, I guess,That we do make our entrance several ways;That, if it chance the one of us do fail,The other yet may rise against their force.Agreed: I'll to yond corner.And I to this.And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave.Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the rightOf English Henry, shall this night appearHow much in duty I am bound to both.Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!How now, my lords! what, all unready so?Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterpriseMore venturous or desperate than this.I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him.Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,Make us partakers of a little gain,That now our loss might be ten times so much?Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!At all times will you have my power alike?Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.Duke of Alencon, this was your default,That, being captain of the watch to-night,Did look no better to that weighty charge.Had all your quarters been as safely keptAs that whereof I had the government,We had not been thus shamefully surprised.Mine was secure.And so was mine, my lord.And, for myself, most part of all this night,Within her quarter and mine own precinctI was employ'd in passing to and fro,About relieving of the sentinels:Then how or which way should they first break in?Question, my lords, no further of the case,How or which way: 'tis sure they found some placeBut weakly guarded, where the breach was made.And now there rests no other shift but this;To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,And lay new platforms to endamage them.I'll be so bold to take what they have left.The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;For I have loaden me with many spoils,Using no other weapon but his name.
