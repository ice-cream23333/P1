Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperouslife, long, and ever happy, to the high and mightyprincess of England, Elizabeth![Kneeling] And to your royal grace, and the good queen,My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,May hourly fall upon ye!Thank you, good lord archbishop:What is her name?Elizabeth.Stand up, lord.With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!Into whose hand I give thy life.Amen.My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,When she has so much English.Let me speak, sir,For heaven now bids me; and the words I utterLet none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--Though in her cradle, yet now promisesUpon this land a thousand thousand blessings,Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--But few now living can behold that goodness--A pattern to all princes living with her,And all that shall succeed: Saba was neverMore covetous of wisdom and fair virtueThan this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,With all the virtues that attend the good,Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:In her days every man shall eat in safety,Under his own vine, what he plants; and singThe merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:God shall be truly known; and those about herFrom her shall read the perfect ways of honour,And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as whenThe bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,Her ashes new create another heir,As great in admiration as herself;So shall she leave her blessedness to one,When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,Who from the sacred ashes of her honourShall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,That were the servants to this chosen infant,Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,His honour and the greatness of his nameShall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branchesTo all the plains about him: our children's childrenShall see this, and bless heaven.Thou speakest wonders.She shall be, to the happiness of England,An aged princess; many days shall see her,And yet no day without a deed to crown it.Would I had known no more! but she must die,She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,A most unspotted lily shall she passTo the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.O lord archbishop,Thou hast made me now a man! never, beforeThis happy child, did I get any thing:This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,That when I am in heaven I shall desireTo see what this child does, and praise my Maker.I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,And your good brethren, I am much beholding;I have received much honour by your presence,And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,She will be sick else. This day, no man thinkHas business at his house; for all shall stay:This little one shall make it holiday.EPILOGUE'Tis ten to one this play can never pleaseAll that are here: some come to take their ease,And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the cityAbused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'Which we have not done neither: that, I fear,All the expected good we're like to hearFor this play at this time, is only inThe merciful construction of good women;For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,And say 'twill do, I know, within a whileAll the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.
