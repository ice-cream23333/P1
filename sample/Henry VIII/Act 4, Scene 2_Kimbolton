How does your grace?O Griffith, sick to death!My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?Yes, madam; but I think your grace,Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:If well, he stepp'd before me, happilyFor my example.Well, the voice goes, madam:For after the stout Earl NorthumberlandArrested him at York, and brought him forward,As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,He fell sick suddenly, and grew so illHe could not sit his mule.Alas, poor man!At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,With all his covent, honourably received him;To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,An old man, broken with the storms of state,Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;Give him a little earth for charity!'So went to bed; where eagerly his sicknessPursued him still: and, three nights after this,About the hour of eight, which he himselfForetold should be his last, full of repentance,Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,He gave his honours to the world again,His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,And yet with charity. He was a manOf an unbounded stomach, ever rankingHimself with princes; one that, by suggestion,Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;His own opinion was his law: i' the presenceHe would say untruths; and be ever doubleBoth in his words and meaning: he was never,But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:His promises were, as he then was, mighty;But his performance, as he is now, nothing:Of his own body he was ill, and gaveThe clergy in example.Noble madam,Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtuesWe write in water. May it please your highnessTo hear me speak his good now?Yes, good Griffith;I were malicious else.This cardinal,Though from an humble stock, undoubtedlyWas fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.And though he were unsatisfied in getting,Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,He was most princely: ever witness for himThose twins Of learning that he raised in you,Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,So excellent in art, and still so rising,That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;For then, and not till then, he felt himself,And found the blessedness of being little:And, to add greater honours to his ageThan man could give him, he died fearing God.After my death I wish no other herald,No other speaker of my living actions,To keep mine honour from corruption,But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,With thy religious truth and modesty,Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,Cause the musicians play me that sad noteI named my knell, whilst I sit meditatingOn that celestial harmony I go to.She is asleep: good wench, let's sit down quiet,For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.Spirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone,And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?Madam, we are here.It is not you I call for:Saw ye none enter since I slept?None, madam.No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troopInvite me to a banquet; whose bright facesCast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?They promised me eternal happiness;And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feelI am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.I am most joyful, madam, such good dreamsPossess your fancy.Bid the music leave,They are harsh and heavy to me.Do you noteHow much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!She is going, wench: pray, pray.Heaven comfort her!An't like your grace,--You are a saucy fellow:Deserve we no more reverence?You are to blame,Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,To use so rude behavior; go to, kneel.I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;My haste made me unmannerly. There is stayingA gentleman, sent from the king, to see you.Admit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellowLet me ne'er see again.If my sight fail not,You should be lord ambassador from the emperor,My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.Madam, the same; your servant.O, my lord,The times and titles now are alter'd strangelyWith me since first you knew me. But, I pray you,What is your pleasure with me?Noble lady,First mine own service to your grace; the next,The king's request that I would visit you;Who grieves much for your weakness, and by meSends you his princely commendations,And heartily entreats you take good comfort.O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;'Tis like a pardon after execution:That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;But now I am past an comforts here, but prayers.How does his highness?Madam, in good health.So may he ever do! and ever flourish,When I shal l dwell with worms, and my poor nameBanish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,I caused you write, yet sent away?No, madam.Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliverThis to my lord the king.Most willing, madam.In which I have commended to his goodnessThe model of our chaste loves, his young daughter;The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--She is young, and of a noble modest nature,I hope she will deserve well,--and a littleTo love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petitionIs, that his noble grace would have some pityUpon my wretched women, that so longHave follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:Of which there is not one, I dare avow,And now I should not lie, but will deserveFor virtue and true beauty of the soul,For honesty and decent carriage,A right good husband, let him be a nobleAnd, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,But poverty could never draw 'em from me;That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,And something over to remember me by:If heaven had pleased to have given me longer lifeAnd able means, we had not parted thus.These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,By that you love the dearest in this world,As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the kingTo do me this last right.By heaven, I will,Or let me lose the fashion of a man!I thank you, honest lord. Remember meIn all humility unto his highness:Say his long trouble now is passingOut of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,Let me be used with honour: strew me overWith maiden flowers, that all the world may knowI was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet likeA queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.I can no more.
