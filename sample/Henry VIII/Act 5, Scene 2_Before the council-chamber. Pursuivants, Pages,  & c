attending.I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman,That was sent to me from the council, pray'd meTo make great haste. All fast? what means this? Ho!Who waits there? Sure, you know me?Yes, my lord;But yet I cannot help you.Why?Your grace must wait till you be call'd for.So.[Aside]  This is a piece of malice. I am gladI came this way so happily: the kingShall understand it presently.[Aside]	'Tis Butts,The king's physician: as he pass'd along,How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!Pray heaven, he sound not my disgrace! For certain,This is of purpose laid by some that hate me--God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice--To quench mine honour: they would shame to make meWait else at door, a fellow-counsellor,'Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasuresMust be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience.I'll show your grace the strangest sight--What's that, Butts?I think your highness saw this many a day.Body o' me, where is it?There, my lord:The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury;Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,Pages, and footboys.Ha! 'tis he, indeed:Is this the honour they do one another?'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thoughtThey had parted so much honesty among 'emAt least, good manners, as not thus to sufferA man of his place, and so near our favour,To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,And at the door too, like a post with packets.By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery:Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:We shall hear more anon.
