Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;Sing, and disperse 'em, if thou canst: leave working.Orpheus with his lute made trees,And the mountain tops that freeze,Bow themselves when he did sing:To his music plants and flowersEver sprung; as sun and showersThere had made a lasting spring.Every thing that heard him play,Even the billows of the sea,Hung their heads, and then lay by.In sweet music is such art,Killing care and grief of heartFall asleep, or hearing, die.How now!An't please your grace, the two great cardinalsWait in the presence.Would they speak with me?They will'd me say so, madam.Pray their gracesTo come near.What can be their businessWith me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,They should be good men; their affairs as righteous:But all hoods make not monks.Peace to your highness!Your graces find me here part of a housewife,I would be all, against the worst may happen.What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?May it please you noble madam, to withdrawInto your private chamber, we shall give youThe full cause of our coming.Speak it here:There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,Deserves a corner: would all other womenCould speak this with as free a soul as I do!My lords, I care not, so much I am happyAbove a number, if my actionsWere tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em,Envy and base opinion set against 'em,I know my life so even. If your businessSeek me out, and that way I am wife in,Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, reginaserenissima,--O, good my lord, no Latin;I am not such a truant since my coming,As not to know the language I have lived in:A strange tongue makes my cause more strange,suspicious;Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,The willing'st sin I ever yet committedMay be absolved in English.Noble lady,I am sorry my integrity should breed,And service to his majesty and you,So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.We come not by the way of accusation,To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,You have too much, good lady; but to knowHow you stand minded in the weighty differenceBetween the king and you; and to deliver,Like free and honest men, our just opinionsAnd comforts to your cause.Most honour'd madam,My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,Forgetting, like a good man your late censureBoth of his truth and him, which was too far,Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,His service and his counsel.[Aside]	To betray me.--My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!But how to make ye suddenly an answer,In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,--More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit,And to such men of gravity and learning,In truth, I know not. I was set at workAmong my maids: full little, God knows, lookingEither for such men or such business.For her sake that I have been,--for I feelThe last fit of my greatness,--good your graces,Let me have time and counsel for my cause:Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:Your hopes and friends are infinite.In EnglandBut little for my profit: can you think, lords,That any Englishman dare give me counsel?Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,They that must weigh out my afflictions,They that my trust must grow to, live not here:They are, as all my other comforts, far henceIn mine own country, lords.I would your graceWould leave your griefs, and take my counsel.How, sir?Put your main cause into the king's protection;He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be muchBoth for your honour better and your cause;For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,You'll part away disgraced.He tells you rightly.Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judgeThat no king can corrupt.Your rage mistakes us.The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?I will not wish ye half my miseries;I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at onceThe burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.Madam, this is a mere distraction;You turn the good we offer into envy.Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon yeAnd all such false professors! would you have me--If you have any justice, any pity;If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,And all the fellowship I hold now with himIs only my obedience. What can happenTo me above this wretchedness? all your studiesMake me a curse like this.Your fears are worse.Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,Never yet branded with suspicion?Have I with all my full affectionsStill met the king? loved him next heaven?obey'd him?Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?Almost forgot my prayers to content him?And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords.Bring me a constant woman to her husband,One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;And to that woman, when she has done most,Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,To give up willingly that noble titleYour master wed me to: nothing but deathShall e'er divorce my dignities.Pray, hear me.Would I had never trod this English earth,Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.What will become of me now, wretched lady!I am the most unhappy woman living.Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,No friend, no hope; no kindred weep for me;Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd,I'll hang my head and perish.If your graceCould but be brought to know our ends are honest,You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,The way of our profession is against it:We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.For goodness' sake, consider what you do;How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterlyGrow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage.The hearts of princes kiss obedience,So much they love it; but to stubborn spiritsThey swell, and grow as terrible as storms.I know you have a gentle, noble temper,A soul as even as a calm: pray, think usThose we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtuesWith these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,As yours was put into you, ever castsSuch doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;Beware you lose it not: for us, if you pleaseTo trust us in your business, we are readyTo use our utmost  studies in your service.Do what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive me,If I have used myself unmannerly;You know I am a woman, lacking witTo make a seemly answer to such persons.Pray, do my service to his majesty:He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayersWhile I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,That little thought, when she set footing here,She should have bought her dignities so dear.
