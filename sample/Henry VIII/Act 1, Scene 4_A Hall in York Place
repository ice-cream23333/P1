Ladies, a general welcome from his graceSalutes ye all; this night he dedicatesTo fair content and you: none here, he hopes,In all this noble bevy, has brought with herOne care abroad; he would have all as merryAs, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,Can make good people. O, my lord, you're tardy:The very thought of this fair companyClapp'd wings to me.You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.Sir Thomas Lovell, had the cardinalBut half my lay thoughts in him, some of theseShould find a running banquet ere they rested,I think would better please 'em: by my life,They are a sweet society of fair ones.O, that your lordship were but now confessorTo one or two of these!I would I were;They should find easy penance.Faith, how easy?As easy as a down-bed would afford it.Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this:His grace is entering. Nay, you must not freeze;Two women placed together makes cold weather:My Lord Sands, you are one will keep 'em waking;Pray, sit between these ladies.By my faith,And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies:If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;I had it from my father.Was he mad, sir?O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too:But he would bite none; just as I do now,He would kiss you twenty with a breath.Well said, my lord.So, now you're fairly seated. Gentlemen,The penance lies on you, if these fair ladiesPass away frowning.For my little cure,Let me alone.You're welcome, my fair guests: that noble lady,Or gentleman, that is not freely merry,Is not my friend: this, to confirm my welcome;And to you all, good health.Your grace is noble:Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,And save me so much talking.My Lord Sands,I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours.Ladies, you are not merry: gentlemen,Whose fault is this?The red wine first must riseIn their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'emTalk us to silence.You are a merry gamester,My Lord Sands.Yes, if I make my play.Here's to your ladyship: and pledge it, madam,For 'tis to such a thing,--You cannot show me.I told your grace they would talk anon.What's that?Look out there, some of ye.What warlike voice,And to what end is this? Nay, ladies, fear not;By all the laws of war you're privileged.How now! what is't?A noble troop of strangers;For so they seem: they've left their barge and landed;And hither make, as great ambassadorsFrom foreign princes.Good lord chamberlain,Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue;And, pray, receive 'em nobly, and conduct 'emInto our presence, where this heaven of beautyShall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.You have now a broken banquet; but we'll mend it.A good digestion to you all: and once moreI shower a welcome on ye; welcome all.A noble company! what are their pleasures?Because they speak no English, thus they pray'dTo tell your grace, that, having heard by fameOf this so noble and so fair assemblyThis night to meet here, they could do no lessOut of the great respect they bear to beauty,But leave their flocks; and, under your fair conduct,Crave leave to view these ladies and entreatAn hour of revels with 'em.Say, lord chamberlain,They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'emA thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,Till now I never knew thee!My lord!Your grace?Pray, tell 'em thus much from me:There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,More worthy this place than myself; to whom,If I but knew him, with my love and dutyI would surrender it.I will, my lord.What say they?Such a one, they all confess,There is indeed; which they would have your graceFind out, and he will take it.Let me see, then.By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I'll makeMy royal choice.Ye have found him, cardinal:You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord:You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, cardinal,I should judge now unhappily.I am gladYour grace is grown so pleasant.My lord chamberlain,Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?An't please your grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter--The Viscount Rochford,--one of her highness' women.By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,I were unmannerly, to take you out,And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!Let it go round.Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet readyI' the privy chamber?Yes, my lord.Your grace,I fear, with dancing is a little heated.I fear, too much.There's fresher air, my lord,In the next chamber.Lead in your ladies, every one: sweet partner,I must not yet forsake you: let's be merry:Good my lord cardinal, I have half a dozen healthsTo drink to these fair ladies, and a measureTo lead 'em once again; and then let's dreamWho's best in favour. Let the music knock it.
