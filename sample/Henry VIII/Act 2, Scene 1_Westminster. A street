Whither away so fast?O, God save ye!Even to the hall, to hear what shall becomeOf the great Duke of Buckingham.I'll save youThat labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremonyOf bringing back the prisoner.Were you there?Yes, indeed, was I.Pray, speak what has happen'd.You may guess quickly what.Is he found guilty?Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.I am sorry for't.So are a number more.But, pray, how pass'd it?I'll tell you in a little. The great dukeCame to the bar; where to his accusationsHe pleaded still not guilty and allegedMany sharp reasons to defeat the law.The king's attorney on the contraryUrged on the examinations, proofs, confessionsOf divers witnesses; which the duke desiredTo have brought viva voce to his face:At which appear'd against him his surveyor;Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,Hopkins, that made this mischief.That was heThat fed him with his prophecies?The same.All these accused him strongly; which he fainWould have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:And so his peers, upon this evidence,Have found him guilty of high treason. MuchHe spoke, and learnedly, for life; but allWas either pitied in him or forgotten.After all this, how did he bear himself?When he was brought again to the bar, to hearHis knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'dWith such an agony, he sweat extremely,And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:But he fell to himself again, and sweetlyIn all the rest show'd a most noble patience.I do not think he fears death.Sure, he does not:He never was so womanish; the causeHe may a little grieve at.CertainlyThe cardinal is the end of this.'Tis likely,By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,Lest he should help his father.That trick of stateWas a deep envious one.At his returnNo doubt he will requite it. This is noted,And generally, whoever the king favours,The cardinal instantly will find employment,And far enough from court too.All the commonsHate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as muchThey love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,The mirror of all courtesy;--Stay there, sir,And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.Let's stand close, and behold him.All good people,You that thus far have come to pity me,Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.I have this day received a traitor's judgment,And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,And if I have a co nscience, let it sink me,Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!The law I bear no malice for my death;'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.For further life in this world I ne'er hope,Nor will I sue, although the king have merciesMore than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,His noble friends and fellows, whom to leaveIs only bitter to him, only dying,Go with me, like good angels, to my end;And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.I do beseech your grace, for charity,If ever any malice in your heartWere hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive youAs I would be forgiven: I forgive all;There cannot be those numberless offences'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:no black envyShall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell himYou met him half in heaven: my vows and prayersYet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,Shall cry for blessings on him: may he liveLonger than I have time to tell his years!Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!And when old time shall lead him to his end,Goodness and he fill up one monument!To the water side I must conduct your grace;Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,Who undertakes you to your end.Prepare there,The duke is coming: see the barge be ready;And fit it with such furniture as suitsThe greatness of his person.Nay, Sir Nicholas,Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.When I came hither, I was lord high constableAnd Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:Yet I am richer than my base accusers,That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,Who first raised head against usurping Richard,Flying for succor to his servant Banister,Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pityingMy father's loss, like a most royal prince,Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,Made my name once more noble. Now his son,Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and allThat made me happy at one stroke has takenFor ever from the world. I had my trial,And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,A little happier than my wretched father:Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: bothFell by our servants, by those men we loved most;A most unnatural and faithless service!Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,This from a dying man receive as certain:Where you are liberal of your loves and counselsBe sure you be not loose; for those you make friendsAnd give your hearts to, when they once perceiveThe least rub in your fortunes, fall awayLike water from ye, never found againBut where they mean to sink ye. All good people,Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hourOf my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:And when you would say something that is sad,Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,I fear, too many curses on their beadsThat were the authors.If the duke be guiltless,'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inklingOf an ensuing evil, if it fall,Greater than this.Good angels keep it from us!What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?This secret is so weighty, 'twill requireA strong faith to conceal it.Let me have it;I do not talk much.I am confident,You shall, sir: did you not of late days hearA buzzing of a separationBetween the king and Katharine?Yes, but it held not:For when the king once heard it, out of angerHe sent command to the lord mayor straightTo stop the rumor, and allay those tonguesThat durst disperse it.But that slander, sir,Is found a truth now: for it grows againFresher than e'er it was; and held for certainThe king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,Or some about him near, have, out of maliceTo the good queen, possess'd him with a scrupleThat will undo her: to confirm this too,Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;As all think, for this business.'Tis the cardinal;And merely to revenge him on the emperorFor not bestowing on him, at his asking,The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruelThat she should feel the smart of this? The cardinalWill have his will, and she must fall.'Tis woful.We are too open here to argue this;Let's think in private more.
