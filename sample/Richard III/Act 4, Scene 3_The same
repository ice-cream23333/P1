The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.The most arch of piteous massacreThat ever yet this land was guilty of.Dighton and Forrest, whom I did subornTo do this ruthless piece of butchery,Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,Melting with tenderness and kind compassionWept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:''Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one anotherWithin their innocent alabaster arms:Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.A book of prayers on their pillow lay;Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'dWhilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smotheredThe most replenished sweet work of nature,That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;They could not speak; and so I left them both,To bring this tidings to the bloody king.And here he comes.All hail, my sovereign liege!Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?If to have done the thing you gave in chargeBeget your happiness, be happy then,For it is done, my lord.But didst thou see them dead?I did, my lord.And buried, gentle Tyrrel?The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;But how or in what place I do not know.Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,And thou shalt tell the process of their death.Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,And be inheritor of thy desire.Farewell till soon.The son of Clarence have I pent up close;His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aimsAt young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.My lord!Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.Ely with Richmond troubles me more nearThan Buckingham and his rash-levied army.Come, I have heard that fearful commentingIs leaden servitor to dull delay;Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggaryThen fiery expedition be my wing,Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
