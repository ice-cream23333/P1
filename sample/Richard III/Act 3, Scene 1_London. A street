Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereignThe weary way hath made you melancholy.No, uncle; but our crosses on the wayHave made it tedious, wearisome, and heavyI want more uncles here to welcome me.Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your yearsHath not yet dived into the world's deceitNor more can you distinguish of a manThan of his outward show; which, God he knows,Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.Those uncles which you want were dangerous;Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :God keep you from them, and from such false friends!God keep me from false friends! but they were none.My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.God bless your grace with health and happy days!I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.I thought my mother, and my brother York,Would long ere this have met us on the wayFie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes notTo tell us whether they will come or no!And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?On what occasion, God he knows, not I,The queen your mother, and your brother York,Have taken sanctuary: the tender princeWould fain have come with me to meet your grace,But by his mother was perforce withheld.Fie, what an indirect and peevish courseIs this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your gracePersuade the queen to send the Duke of YorkUnto his princely brother presently?If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratoryCan from his mother win the Duke of York,Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurateTo mild entreaties, God in heaven forbidWe should infringe the holy privilegeOf blessed sanctuary! not for all this landWould I be guilty of so deep a sin.You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,Too ceremonious and traditionalWeigh it but with the grossness of this age,You break not sanctuary in seizing him.The benefit thereof is always grantedTo those whose dealings have deserved the place,And those who have the wit to claim the place:This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:Then, taking him from thence that is not there,You break no privilege nor charter there.Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;But sanctuary children ne'er till now.My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?I go, my lord.Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?Where it seems best unto your royal self.If I may counsel you, some day or twoYour highness shall repose you at the Tower:Then where you please, and shall be thought most fitFor your best health and recreation.I do not like the Tower, of any place.Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.Is it upon record, or else reportedSuccessively from age to age, he built it?Upon record, my gracious lord.But say, my lord, it were not register'd,Methinks the truth should live from age to age,As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,Even to the general all-ending day.[Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do neverlive long.What say you, uncle?I say, without characters, fame lives long.Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,I moralize two meanings in one word.That Julius Caesar was a famous man;With what his valour did enrich his wit,His wit set down to make his valour liveDeath makes no conquest of this conqueror;For now he lives in fame, though not in life.I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--What, my gracious lord?An if I live until I be a man,I'll win our ancient right in France again,Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.[Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:Too late he died that might have kept that title,Which by his death hath lost much majesty.How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,You said that idle weeds are fast in growthThe prince my brother hath outgrown me far.He hath, my lord.And therefore is he idle?O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.Then is he more beholding to you than I.He may command me as my sovereign;But you have power in me as in a kinsman.I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.A beggar, brother?Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.A gentle cousin, were it light enough.O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.It is too heavy for your grace to wear.I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.What, would you have my weapon, little lord?I would, that I might thank you as you call me.How?Little.My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;Because that I am little, like an ape,He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,He prettily and aptly taunts himself:So cunning and so young is wonderful.My lord, will't please you pass along?Myself and my good cousin BuckinghamWill to your mother, to entreat of herTo meet you at the Tower and welcome you.What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?My lord protector needs will have it so.I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.Why, what should you fear?Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:My grandam told me he was murdered there.I fear no uncles dead.Nor none that live, I hope.An if they live, I hope I need not fear.But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.Think you, my lord, this little prating YorkWas not incensed by his subtle motherTo taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capableHe is all the mother's, from the top to toe.Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intendAs closely to conceal what we impart:Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;What think'st thou? is it not an easy matterTo make William Lord Hastings of our mind,For the instalment of this noble dukeIn the seat royal of this famous isle?He for his father's sake so loves the prince,That he will not be won to aught against him.What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?He will do all in all as Hastings doth.Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,How doth he stand affected to our purpose;And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,To sit about the coronation.If thou dost find him tractable to us,Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,And give us notice of his inclination:For we to-morrow hold divided councils,Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,His ancient knot of dangerous adversariesTo-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.My good lords both, with all the heed I may.Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?You shall, my lord.At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceiveLord Hastings will not yield to our complots?Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:And, look, when I am king, claim thou of meThe earldom of Hereford, and the moveablesWhereof the king my brother stood possess'd.I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.And look to have it yielded with all willingness.Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwardsWe may digest our complots in some form.
