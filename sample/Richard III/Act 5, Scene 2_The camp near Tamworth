Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,Thus far into the bowels of the landHave we march'd on without impediment;And here receive we from our father StanleyLines of fair comfort and encouragement.The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his troughIn your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swineLies now even in the centre of this isle,Near to the town of Leicester, as we learnFrom Tamworth thither is but one day's march.In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,To reap the harvest of perpetual peaceBy this one bloody trial of sharp war.Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,To fight against that bloody homicide.I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
