My lords, at once: the cause why we are metIs, to determine of the coronation.In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?Are all things fitting for that royal time?It is, and wants but nomination.To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?Who is most inward with the royal duke?Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,Than I of yours;Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;But, for his purpose in the coronation.I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'dHis gracious pleasure any way therein:But you, my noble lords, may name the time;And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,My absence doth neglect no great designs,Which by my presence might have been concluded.Had not you come upon your cue, my lordWilliam Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.I thank your grace.My lord of Ely!My lord?When I was last in Holborn,I saw good strawberries in your garden thereI do beseech you send for some of them.Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,And finds the testy gentleman so hot,As he will lose his head ere give consentHis master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.We have not yet set down this day of triumph.To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;For I myself am not so well providedAs else I would be, were the day prolong'd.Where is my lord protector? I have sent for thesestrawberries.His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;There's some conceit or other likes him well,When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.I think there's never a man in ChristendomThat can less hide his love or hate than he;For by his face straight shall you know his heart.What of his heart perceive you in his faceBy any likelihood he show'd to-day?Marry, that with no man here he is offended;For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.I pray God he be not, I say.I pray you all, tell me what they deserveThat do conspire my death with devilish plotsOf damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'dUpon my body with their hellish charms?The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,Makes me most forward in this noble presenceTo doom the offenders, whatsoever they beI say, my lord, they have deserved death.Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine armIs, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,I will not dine until I see the same.Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;For I, too fond, might have prevented this.Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.O, now I want the priest that spake to me:I now repent I told the pursuivantAs 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,And I myself secure in grace and favour.O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curseIs lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.O momentary grace of mortal men,Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,Ready, with every nod, to tumble downInto the fatal bowels of the deep.Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.O bloody Richard! miserable England!I prophesy the fearful'st time to theeThat ever wretched age hath look'd upon.Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
