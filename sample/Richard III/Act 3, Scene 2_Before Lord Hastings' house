What, ho! my lord![Within]  Who knocks at the door?A messenger from the Lord Stanley.What is't o'clock?Upon the stroke of four.Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?So it should seem by that I have to say.First, he commends him to your noble lordship.And then?And then he sends you wordHe dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:Besides, he says there are two councils held;And that may be determined at the onewhich may make you and him to rue at the other.Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,If presently you will take horse with him,And with all speed post with him toward the north,To shun the danger that his soul divines.Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;Bid him not fear the separated councilsHis honour and myself are at the one,And at the other is my servant CatesbyWhere nothing can proceed that toucheth usWhereof I shall not have intelligence.Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fondTo trust the mockery of unquiet slumbersTo fly the boar before the boar pursues,Were to incense the boar to follow usAnd make pursuit where he did mean no chase.Go, bid thy master rise and come to meAnd we will both together to the Tower,Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.Many good morrows to my noble lord!Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirringWhat news, what news, in this our tottering state?It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;And I believe twill never stand uprightTill Richard wear the garland of the realm.How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?Ay, my good lord.I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shouldersEre I will see the crown so foul misplaced.But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forwardUpon his party for the gain thereof:And thereupon he sends you this good news,That this same very day your enemies,The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,Because they have been still mine enemies:But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,To bar my master's heirs in true descent,God knows I will not do it, to the death.God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,That they who brought me in my master's hateI live to look upon their tragedy.I tell thee, Catesby--What, my lord?Ere a fortnight make me elder,I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,When men are unprepared and look not for it.O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it outWith Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill doWith some men else, who think themselves as safeAs thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dearTo princely Richard and to Buckingham.The princes both make high account of you;For they account his head upon the bridge.I know they do; and I have well deserved it.Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,I do not like these several councils, I.My lord,I hold my life as dear as you do yours;And never in my life, I do protest,Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:Think you, but that I know our state secure,I would be so triumphant as I am?The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.They, for their truth, might better wear their headsThan some that have accused them wear their hats.But come, my lord, let us away.Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?The better that your lordship please to ask.I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me nowThan when I met thee last where now we meet:Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,By the suggestion of the queen's allies;But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--This day those enemies are put to death,And I in better state than e'er I was.God hold it, to your honour's good content!Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.God save your lordship!Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.I am in your debt for your last exercise;Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.Good faith, and when I met this holy man,Those men you talk of came into my mind.What, go you toward the Tower?I do, my lord; but long I shall not stayI shall return before your lordship thence.'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.[Aside]  And supper too, although thou know'st it not.Come, will you go?I'll wait upon your lordship.
